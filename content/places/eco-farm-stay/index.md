## First Steps From Here To There?

Five years time?
stay in different country locations
can go camping for family holidays
go to furniture auctions, to get comfortable with them
Internet research e.g. tourism statistics
where do people stay?
what facilities are available?
how much do people pay? competition?
what is in the locale? e.g. waterfalls

## And Then?

Can you do a good breakfast? For five families at once? Prove it! :-)

business plan:

- budget
- advertising (e.g. website)
- business loan
- renovation quotes

## What types of hobby farms are there?

The short answer is; how many hobbies can you name? Perhaps you love wines and want to buy a small vineyard, or maybe youâ€™re mechanically minded and want space for workshops and garages for your fleet of collectible cars?

Other common hobby farm possibilities and features to look for include:

<ul>
 	<li>Pastures full of free-range poultry</li>
 	<li>Expanses of bushland for rough riding horses</li>
 	<li>Swathes of flat fertile land for growing fruit trees</li>
 	<li>Rolling hills and plains for a menagerie of livestock and other animals</li>
 	<li>Creeks for fishing and water sports</li>
</ul>
