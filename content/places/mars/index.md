Would you ever live on Mars, if you had the opportunity (pun intended)? I absolutely would, provided it had been proven
"safe enough" â€” that is, I wouldn't want to be one of the first. But imagine it! Terraforming a brand new world!
Becoming a extraterrestrial civilisation!

My fear is that I won't get the choice, but on the off-chance that I ever achieve immortality, I'd certainly look to
moving off-world in a century or two. _This is the future I dream of!_
