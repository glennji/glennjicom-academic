## Why am I reading this book?

I've been considering (and tapering) my alcohol consumption for maybe six months now, wondering how an activity with the potential for such negative consequences became integrated with our social structures, and this book seems to be a continuation of the exploration of these thoughts.  If I'm honest, I don't think I have a "problem" with drinking -- there have been occasions that I felt "compelled" to have a drink (boredom, mostly?) but I'm typically fine if I don't and frequently go for weeks without.

Investigating my unconscious mind, however, seems like it could be useful; I hope that any awareness and/or techniques that I find through this book will apply to other aspects of my life.

## Chapter 1
