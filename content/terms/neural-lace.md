A <em>neural lace</em> is an ultra-thin mesh of electrodes which can be implanted in, or otherwise delivered to, living biological tissue. It can then be used for monitoring and/or electrical signalling, which the most commonly cited use being the creation of a <strong>brain-machine interface</strong> by the reading and stimulation of individual <a href="http://glennji.com/lexicon/neuron/">neurons</a> via a 3D mesh embedded within the brain. Several companies are working on lace technology, including Elon Musk's <em>Neuralink</em>.
