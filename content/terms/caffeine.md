Caffeine is a stimulant and alkaloid derivative of xanthine (other "xanthines" include theobromine). When ingested, it takes effect quickly as an adenoisine receptor _antagonist_ (i.e. blocking). Caffeine reaches peak blood-levels within 30-60 minutes and has a half-life of 3 to 5 hours.

Coffee accounts for 54% (ref?) of caffeine consumption in the world and is made from roasted, dried and ground beans of a plant from genus _coffea_, native to tropical Asia and tropical & southern Africa. There are more than 120 different _coffea_ species, with _Coffea Arabica_ and _Coffea Canephora_ ("robusta") accounting for the majority of global coffee production.

(I probably drink too much coffee. Something I should think about in my personal development?)
