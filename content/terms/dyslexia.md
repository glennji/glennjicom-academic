Dyslexia is a term used to describe a reading and spelling difficulty which affects an estimated 3-17% of the population to some degree, and likely has both genetic and environmental neurological causes. It is characterized by difficulties with accurate/fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. These difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonological component of language that is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction.

<h3>Multisensory Learning</h3>
Multisensory activities help dyslexic children absorb and process information in a retainable manner and involve using senses like touch and movement alongside sight and hearing.
Examples of multi sensory activities for the classroom include:
<ul>
 	<li>Writing words and sentences with tactile materials,e.g. glitter glue, sand, pasta, LEGO, or beads.</li>
 	<li>Physical activities to practice spelling, e.g.hopscotch or jump-rope – the children spell out words when they jump to each square or over the rope. Students work in pairs and take turns to dictate words and spell them.</li>
 	<li>Scavenger hunts for letters and words – split students into teams and give them a word. Next, write letters onto notes and hide them around the classroom.The teams must find the letters to construct the assigned word and then glue them together on a poster by cutting out the letters</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assistive tools and techniques</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>pocket spell checkers</li>
 	<li>line readers</li>
 	<li>keyboards</li>
 	<li>Cloze procedure</li>
 	<li>Green pen and positivity in corrections</li>
</ul>
