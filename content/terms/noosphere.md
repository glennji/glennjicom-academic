> The <b>noosphere</b> (sometimes <b>noösphere</b>) is the sphere of human thought. The word derives from the Greek νοῦς (nous "mind") and σφαῖρα (sphaira "sphere"), in lexical analogy to "atmosphere" and "biosphere".
> It was introduced by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in 1922 in his <i>Cosmogenesis</i>.
