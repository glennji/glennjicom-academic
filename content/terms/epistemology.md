Epistemology (from Greek ἐπιστήμη (epistēmē), meaning "knowledge, science", and λόγος (logos), meaning "the study of") is the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature and scope (limitations) of knowledge itself:

 - what is knowledge?
 - how is it acquired?
 - how do we know it?

This philosophy deals with knowledge, truth, belief and doubt.
