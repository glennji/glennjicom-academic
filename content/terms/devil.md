"The Devil" is an evil figure in the Abrahamic religions/mythos, defiant of the will of God and eternal opposer. The devil has many different names, and has a role in many of the Abrahamic holy books:

 * Satan, (or Shaitan, "the deceiver" in Jewish)
 * Lucifer "the light bringer" (doesn't sound so bad!)
 * Bealzubub, possibly a grammatic joke: changing "Baal Bezuz" (Lord of the Valley) to "Baal Zebub" (Lord of the flies). Those funny early priests!
 * "Father of Lies"
 * Abaddon[^1]

... and others.

[^1]: Abaddon (Hebrew: אֲבַדּוֹן, 'Ǎḇaddōn, Greek: Apollyon, Latin: Exterminans, Coptic: Abbaton, meaning "A place of destruction", "The Destroyer", "Depths of Hell") in the Revelation of St. John, is the king of tormenting locusts and the angel of the bottomless pit. The exact nature of Abaddon is debated, but the Hebrew word is related to the triliteral root אבד (ABD), which in verb form means "to perish."

The devil rules in hell over the souls of either sinners or non-believers (or both). He is sometimes considered the source of all evil. Satan is usually considered a fallen angel, one of many but also originally a trusted "lieutenant" of God.

It seems to be common practise of the churches to declaim other gods, beliefs or even customs as "the work of the devil".
