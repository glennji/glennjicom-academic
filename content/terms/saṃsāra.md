Saṅsāra or Saṃsāra (sanskrit: संसार), literally meaning "continuous flow", is the cycle of birth, life, death, rebirth or reincarnation) within Buddhism, Hinduism, Bön, Jainism, Sikhism, and other Indian religions.

In Buddhism, the consciousness (consciousness of the different senses, such as eye consciousness, ear consciousness etc.), at the moment of death, act as the seed for the spawning of the new consciousness in a new biological structure, conducive to the volitional (saṅkhāras) impulses at the moment of death (which are themselves affected by previous volitional impulses). In other Indian religions, the volitional impulses accrued from the present life are transmitted to a consciousness structure popularly known as the soul, which, after an intermediate period (in Tibetan called the bardo), forms the basis for a new biological structure that will result in rebirth and a new life. This cyclical process ends in the attainment of mokṣa.
