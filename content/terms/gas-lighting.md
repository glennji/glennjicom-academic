The term “gaslighting” refers to when someone manipulates you into questioning and second-guessing your reality. It derives from a 1944 movie – and the play and another film that preceded it – in which this happens to the heroine.

Gas Light (often spelled as Gaslight and known in the United States as Five Chelsea Lane and Angel Street) is a 1938 play by the British dramatist Patrick Hamilton.
