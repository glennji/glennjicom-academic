<em>Bulletproof® </em>is the trademark label of biohacker Dave Asprey ("the bulletproof executive"), and applies to diet, exercise, supplements and even a kind of "philosophy for life" (read: cult?). I first came across it in the form of "bulletproof coffee" -- black coffee with organic, grass-fed butter and MCT oil, mixed in a blender -- and, being a fledgeling biohacker myself, gave it a whirl (har har).

Yum! Filling! Delicious!

These days I'm "bulletproof fasting" with a BP coffee (including BrainOctane® MCT oil) for breakfast and nothing else until around 1pm. (Am I still in the "intermittent fasting" state when I do this? Not sure. Can I design an experiment to find out, I wonder?) I'm also trying twelve-weeks of a ketogenic diet, which marries up nicely with the Bulletproof® Diet (raw, unprocessed, low carb), as well as BP-coffee (high fat, near-zero carb).

From Dave's website (so I can find it again):
<h3><strong>The Best Hangover Cures: 5 Steps To Hack Your Hangover</strong></h3>
<strong>Step 1 </strong><em>(optional)</em><strong><em>: Choose the alcohol that will cause the least hangover problems.</em></strong>
There are tons of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alcoholic_beverages">types of alcohol</a> but the most common ones are represented here. What you choose can make a huge difference in how you feel the next morning. Some alcohols have a lot more toxic byproducts from fermentation than others. They are, in order from <strong>best</strong> to <strong>worst</strong>: <span id="more-49"></span>Vodka, gin, tequila, whiskey, other distilled spirits, dry cider, dry champagne, dry white wine, white wines, red wines, dessert wines, beer.
Tragically, beer has the most toxins of any common alcoholic beverage…
<strong>Step 2: </strong><strong>Hydrate heavily by drinking a glass of water for every serving of alcohol you consume – ideally at the same time or right after.</strong>
Before you can eliminate toxins, your body dilutes them with water so they don’t harm you on the way out.  The water either comes from your tissues or water you drink – so drink water.
<strong>Step 3:</strong><strong> </strong><em>(critical)</em><strong> </strong><strong>Block the conversion of alcohol into aldehyde, the most hangover-causing metabolite that also causes very fast aging, wrinkles, etc.</strong>
Before each drink, take one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7QG1S?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwbetterbaby-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001G7QG1S">Vitamin C capsule</a>, along with a capsule of <a href="http://www.bulletproof.com/unfair-advantage-30-ampules-net-contents-120-ml">Unfair Advantage</a>.
<strong>Step 4: Do more if you want.</strong>
Best:  The most powerful detoxer for the liver I know of is <a href="http://www.bulletproof.com/glutathione-force-orange-spice-net-wt-1-35-fl-oz">lipoceutical glutathione</a>. That’s what I use if I drink.
Good: Add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014FT9W?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwbetterbaby-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00014FT9W">Vitamin B-1 </a>and/or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OXBH6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwbetterbaby-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013OXBH6">Alpha Lipoic Acid</a> and/or  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OUQ3S?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwbetterbaby-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013OUQ3S">N-Acetyl Cysteine</a> before each drink, or at least before your first and after your last drink.  Those links have the correct dosages and are low cost per drink (I recommend those ones for fastest absorption.)
<strong>Step 5: Mop Up What’s Left.</strong>
Take 4 capsules of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7R2WK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwbetterbaby-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001G7R2WK">Activated Charcoal </a>after you’re done drinking (or if you chose beer or wine, take 1 capsule with each drink).
