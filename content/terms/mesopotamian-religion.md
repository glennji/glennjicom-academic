A few traces remained among <a title="Assyrian people" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people">Assyrian</a> communities in isolated pockets of what had been Assyria until the 10th century AD, with the very latest attestation being found in this region in the 16th century AD.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Mesopotamian_religion#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> The religious development of Mesopotamia and Mesopotamian culture in general was not particularly influenced by the movements of the various peoples into and throughout the area, particularly the south. Rather, Mesopotamian religion was a consistent and coherent tradition which adapted to the internal needs of its adherents over millennia of development.<sup id="cite_ref-brit_2-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Mesopotamian_religion#cite_note-brit-2">[2]</a></sup></em>
