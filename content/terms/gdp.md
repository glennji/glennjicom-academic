GDP measures the total income of a nation: the total income of everyone in the economy AND the total expenditure on the economy's output of goods and services.

> The reason that GDP can perform the trick of measuring both total income and total expenditure is that these two things are really the same.

**For an economy as a whole, income must equal expenditure**

i.e. if Doug pays Katey $100 for a dance, Katey *earns* $100 while Doug *spends* $100. Whether GDP is measured by income or expenditure, the number is the same.

NOTE: What about international trade? Feels like trade surplus/shortage is where the interesting stuff happens.

> Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time.

A few tricks:

* "market value" i.e. the amount that people are willing ot pay for different goods and services
* "of all" all items produced in the economy and sold legally in markets.
* "final goods and services" means those goods that are sold as they are intended to be used, not as an input to another good/service. For example, we don't count the cardboard sold to a Christmas card company as the value there will be measured by the sale of the cards themselves.
* "in a given period of time" - Usually a year, but should be specified.

# Composition of GDP

$$ Y = C + I + G + X{net} $$

- C: _consumption_
- I: _investment_
- G: _goverment purchases_
- X: _exports_ (net)


# Nominal, real and the GDP deflator

$$ GDP Deflator = \frac {GDP_{nominal}}{GDP_{real}} \times 100 $$

# GDP as a measure of economic wellbeing

* because GDP uses market prices to value goods and services, it excludes almost all activity that takes place outside of those markets. This includes child-rearing and volunteer work (other things?).

Other measures:

* MAP
* GNH
* SPI
