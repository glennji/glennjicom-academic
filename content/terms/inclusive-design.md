Inclusive design is:

> ...[t]he design of mainstream products and/or services that are accessible to, and usable by, as many people as reasonably possible ... without the need for special adaptation or specialised design.

[^1]: British Standards Institute (2005) standard BS 7000-6:2005: "Design management systems - Managing inclusive design"

i.e. a design methodology that considers everyone, including the 20% of the population who identify as having a disability ("difficulty" in Microsoft parlance).

"Inclusive", then, means designing products that may address the needs of a wide(r) range of potential customers/users, including those with disabilities and/or difficulties e.g. hearing, sight, cognitive impairment; restricted mobility; etc. There are a few ways to do this, including:

  - developing a _family_ of products (or derivatives of products) that address specific needs (or solve particular problems) for different categories
  - ensuring that each product/offering has clear and distinct target users
  - reducing the ability required to use each product

Consider the impact on:

  1. People
  2. Profit
  3. Planet

... across the entire lifecycle:

  1. Development
  2. Production
  3. Distribution
  4. Use
  5. "Pass it on"
  6. Reprocessing

[Seven principles for inclusive design](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/):
  1. Provide comparable experience
  2. Consider the situation
  3. Be consistent
  4. Give control
  5. Offer choice
  6. Prioritize content
  7. Add value
