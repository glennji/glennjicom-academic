*"Bardo"* (བར་དོ, Sanskrit: *antarabhāva*) refers to an "intermediate state" between death and rebirth, a concept which supposedly arose shortly after the Buddha's death. According to <a title="Tibet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet">Tibetan</a> tradition, after death and before one's next birth, when one's consciousness is not connected with a physical body, one experiences a variety of phenomena. These usually follow a particular sequence of degeneration from, just after death, the clearest experiences of reality of which one is spiritually capable, and then proceeding to terrifying hallucinations that arise from the impulses of one's previous unskillful actions.

For the prepared and appropriately trained individuals the bardo offers a state of great opportunity for liberation, since transcendental insight may arise with the direct experience of reality, while for others it can become a place of danger as the karmically created hallucinations can impel one into a less than desirable rebirth.
