Saint Bede, or "Bede the venerable" (Latin: <i lang="la">Bēda Venerābilis</i>), was a Benedictine monk (CE 672/3-735) at the monastery of St. Peter and its companion monastery of St. Paul in the Kingdom of Northumbria of the Angles (contemporarily Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey in Tyne and Wear, England) who gained the title "The Father of English History" for his authorship of the <em>Ecclesiastical History of the English People</em>. (Interesting to me: "Monkwearmouth" refers to the Wear river; a nearby area was known as "Bishopwearmouth". Modern day Sunderland.)
