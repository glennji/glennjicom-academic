# Courses and study notes

I've never been a particularly organised student, prefering to get by on "pure intellect" and first-pricinples rather than best practice. Of course, the busier you are, the less effective that approach becomes, and I'm nothing if not busy. So these pages[^1] are my attempt to actually take some decent notes.

Below you'll find a growing list of the things I'm actually actively trying to study. Follow along! It could be fun!

[^1]: No, seriously, how did you find this page? It's not currently linked to anything (I think), so you must be doing some URL spelunking perhaps? However you did it, well done you.
