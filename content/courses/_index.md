# Courses and study notes

I've never been a particularly organised student, prefering to get by on "pure intellect"[^2] and first-pricinples rather than best practice. Of course, the busier you are, the less effective that approach becomes, and I'm nothing if not busy. So these pages[^1] are my attempt to actually take some decent notes.

[^2]: I'm not claiming to be clever by any means, and honestly I think my lack of study abilities suggests the opposite. I mean, I *think* I'm smart, but doesn't everyone? `#iamverysmart`
[^1]: No, seriously, how did you find this page? It's not currently linked to anything (I think), so you must be doing some URL spelunking perhaps? However you did it, well done you. 

Below you'll find a growing list of the things I'm actually actively trying to study. Follow along! It could be fun!
