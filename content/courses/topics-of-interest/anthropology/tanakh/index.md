The Hebrew Bible (also Hebrew Scriptures, Latin _Biblia Hebraica_) is a term used by biblical scholars to refer to the Jewish Bible (Hebrew: תנ"ך Tanakh). It takes its name from the fact that the Jewish Bible is composed mostly in Biblical Hebrew, with a few passages in Biblical Aramaic (about half of the Book of Daniel, some parts of the Book of Ezra and a few other passages).
