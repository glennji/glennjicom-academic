# A SOLDIER’S PRAYER

> I'm asking You God, to give me what You have left.
> Give me those things which others never ask of You.
> I don't ask You for rest, or tranquility.
> Not that of the spirit, the body, or the mind.
> I don't ask You for wealth, or success, or even health.
> All those things are asked of You so much Lord,
> that you can't have any left to give.
> Give me instead Lord what You have left.
> Give me what others don't want.
> I want uncertainty and doubt.
> I want torment and battle.
> And I ask that You give them to me now and forever Lord,
> so I can be sure to always have them,
> because I won't always have the strength to ask again.
> But give me also the courage, the energy,
> and the spirit to face them.
> I ask You these things Lord,
> because I can't ask them of myself.

### — André Louis Arthur Zirnheld
