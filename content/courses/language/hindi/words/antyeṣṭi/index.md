*Antyeṣṭi* (अन्त्येष्टि) is a composite Sanskrit word of *antya* and *iṣṭi*, which respectively mean "last" and "sacrifice".[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antyesti#cite_note-8) Together, the word means the "last sacrifice". Similarly, the phrase *Antima Sanskara* literally means "last sacred ceremony, or last rite of passage".
