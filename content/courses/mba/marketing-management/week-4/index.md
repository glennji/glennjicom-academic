# Objectives

By the end of this week you should be able to:

- list the 10-step product plan process
- identify the key factors that should be considered when undertaking and implementing the planning process.

## 10 step product plan process

1. Business Context

4. Forecast
   1. to set realistic objectives
5. Fit - Product & Forecast
   1. to consider likely outcomes of current approach
6. SWOT
   1. builds on (5) above
7. New approaches
   1. to generate as many objective-approach pairs as possible
8. Select best approach
   1. identify the best objectives and approach to tae forward
9. Write the plan
10. Implement the plan

### What's the difference between the plans?

> Think of a business plan and a marketing plan in terms of a pizza. A business plan is the whole pizza. A marketing plan is a slice of pizza. A product launch plan would be the ingredients on the slice of the pizza which constitutes the marketing plan. 

### Key factors to be considered

The following potential issues should be considered when undertaking the planning process:

* ideas may exist in someone's brain, rather than formally undertaking the process steps
* data might be "assumed" rather than collected
* overgeneralisation
* unnecessary detail
* unfounded, unrealistic assumpts
* lack of "future proofing"

Loopbacks are necessary and often a frequent part of the process.
