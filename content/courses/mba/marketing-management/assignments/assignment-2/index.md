# Product-CX Launch Plan

> *Working in teams of 2–4, share your products/service concepts and the external component audit and forecasts you each completed for Assignment 1. As a team, agree on one product/service concept to take forward as a team.*

#### Section 1: SWOT (100 words or equivalent)

Compare your product with the future environment. What are the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the *future*? You will need to use the research and analysis from Assignment 1’s demand audit to justify this section.

Your team should be asking themselves these questions as they prepare the SWOT:

- What is my product/service’s competitive position? Am I at an advantage or disadvantage?
- What is the potential growth in end user numbers?
- How acceptable is the product to the powerful players in the demand ecosystem?
- How much support can we rely on from the powerful players in the demand ecosystem?

Include your SWOT table in this section. Two to three ideas in each box is plenty and there is no need to submit a paragraph summarising your results, however, you must include the data sources you’ve used. Data sources must be cited, but no reference to academic theory is necessary in this assignment. You will demonstrate an understanding of what you have learnt through the *application* of the theory, rather than by *reference* to it. Feel free to create your own SWOT table or use this [SWOT analysis template (DOC 29 KB)](https://swinburneonline.instructure.com/courses/2008/files/1416603/download?wrap=1).

For more on SWOT go to [2.5 Assessing environmental sources of influence](https://swinburneonline.instructure.com/courses/2008/pages/2-dot-5-assessing-environmental-sources-of-influence).

#### Section 2: Strategic stance (100 words)

There are four prototypical approaches to the market. Companies can:

1. mass-market
2. segment the market
3. differentiate the product
4. customise the product to individual customers.

Choose one and develop your approach. This is covered in [6.2 Product strategies in the node](https://swinburneonline.instructure.com/courses/2008/pages/6-dot-2-product-strategies-in-the-node).

------

#### Section 3: Demand ecosystem (100 words or equivalent)

Identify and draw your product's demand ecosystem.

Mapping of the demand ecosystem is covered in [2.2 The demand ecosystem](https://swinburneonline.instructure.com/courses/2008/pages/2-dot-2-the-demand-ecosystem).

------

#### Section 4: Two touchpoints (100 words)

Within the demand ecosystem, you have identified all the players. Your team will select two of them as touchpoints to focus on. These should be the two most powerful players in the demand ecosystem—for example, the internet, retailers, celebrities, or end user groups.

------

#### Section 5: Customer experience at each of the two touchpoints (900–1000 words)

How you approach this will depend on which strategic stance your team has chosen.

Describe your ideal contact at each touchpoint, how it stimulates behaviour and the purchase and consumption behaviour you want from each touchpoint.

Your team will need to tell the customer’s story at the touchpoints, explaining how this will influence the customer to deliver the purchase and consumption behaviour. Your story should be told around goods, price, brand, service, and communications.

Refer to [7.2 Customer experience at each touchpoint](https://swinburneonline.instructure.com/courses/2008/pages/7-dot-2-customer-experience-at-each-touchpoint) for guidance

Describe your ideal contact at each touch point, how it stimulaties behaviour and the purchase and consumption behaviours you want.

#### Section 6: Launch plan implementation schedule (100 words or equivalent)

Prepare a schedule to implement the launch plan. Your schedule should list the activities (for example, a special promotion) you have planned and when they’ll take place.

You will find launch plan examples in [11.3 Launch plans](https://swinburneonline.instructure.com/courses/2008/pages/11-dot-3-launch-plans).

You can create your own launch plan implementation schedule or use this [Launch plan implementation template (XLS 42 KB)](https://swinburneonline.instructure.com/courses/2008/files/1416539/download?wrap=1).

Always include the responsible person.

------

#### Section 7: Implementation (400–500 words)

In this final section, your team will need to flesh out the activities in the implementation schedule. These activities will depend on which strategic stance your team has chosen.

The activities you might like to include is covered in [11.2 Getting your message out](https://swinburneonline.instructure.com/courses/2008/pages/11-dot-2-getting-your-message-out). For framing around your selected activities, refer to the principles covered in [10.4 Force Authority Manipulation Persuasion (FAMP)](https://swinburneonline.instructure.com/courses/2008/pages/10-dot-4-force-authority-manipulation-persuasion-famp).
