You are required to provide a brief overview of a proposed product concept, including the category and name of the product, the brand and associated services.

You will also state the geographic boundary of your analysis (Australia, Victoria, inner-city Melbourne etc.) and an expected price range. You will also need to clearly identify what problem your product will solve and for whom.

## Demand-Product Alignment

Make sure you include [Assignment 1A] in your final submission of this assignment. This does not contribute towards the word count.

### External audit (500 words)

Carry out the external component of the demand-alignment audit as studied in [Week 2: Auditing the marketing environment](https://swinburneonline.instructure.com/courses/2008/pages/2-dot-1-this-weeks-focus). Your goal is to understand what’s driving the demand ecosystem and the customers. You will therefore need to identify who the most powerful players are in the demand ecosystem.

| Meso                                       | Demand ecosystem (information flows, cash flows, product flows) | The influence/connection between meso > micro.               |
| Micro                                      | Critical actors/agents/value adders in the demand process (ecosystem touchpoints). Could be consumers, purchasers, influencers, retailers. |                                                              |

The external audit requires you to collect facts and data, which you will use to prepare the forecast and estimated demand for three years. Avoid collection of background data for data’s sake. The only decisions you need to make here are about what data to collect, from where and how to select for *relevancy* and *usefulness*. You must include three competitors or potential substitutes, unless you have evidence that there are none.

### Forecast and estimated demand for three years (400 words)

Prepare a scenario forecast for the *future* demand of your product over the next three years. Use your own insights based on the factual analysis, draw conclusions and identify any assumptions you have made. Your forecast is qualitative, rather than quantitative.

You will need to use very concise English to present your findings and forecast within the word limit. Remember that *relevance* and *usefulness* in determining demand for your product in the next three years is all that is necessary. You are not expected to produce a macro-economic forecast.

Data sources must be cited, but no reference to academic theory is necessary in this assignment. You will demonstrate an understanding of what you have learnt through the application of the theory, rather than by reference to it.

The content covered in [Week 3: Forecasting](https://swinburneonline.instructure.com/courses/2008/pages/3-dot-1-this-weeks-focus) will help you with this section.
