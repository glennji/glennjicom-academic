summary: |
  The purpose of this paper is to define the contours of a new 	marketing attuned to the information age, and to introduce the concept of marketing 	ecosystems as a new framework for competitive strategy. This paper draws on five 	years of research and consulting experience applying general systems theory to 	strategy design, backed by the author's nearly 20 years field experience in the 	marketing services industry. There is a conceptual gap between thinking systems 	used by marketers to create novelty and demonstrate value, the "ground truth" of a 	saturated information environment, and the currents shaping major directional 	change in the world. Marketers adopt management strategies that consistently trail, 	rather than anticipate, technological change. Making strategic choices to compete 	between and within marketing ecosystems - system-level competition - is now an 	increasing focus of business strategy. The paper provides new metaphors to frame 	brand management for system-level competition, a new orientation to create novelty 	in marketing, and a new path to solve complex problems of marketing and sales 	performance.

# Framing brand management for marketing ecosystems

==Marketing ecosystems== are a ==new framework for strategy management==. They shift the view of "brand" as the primary unit for strategy-making to an aggregated view of competitive strategy and action at the system level. Advantage goes to those marketers who do the better job of ==designing ecosystems with mutually-reinforcing effects== from internal and external assets, and managing the ecosystems for growth, innovation, and continual improvement.

> "I think traditional 30-second advertising is in serious danger," says Andrea Ragnetti, Chief Marketing Officer of Phillips Electronics. He's looking for other media properties that reach Philips's customer - middle-aged, affluent and well-educated - with an eye toward developing unique ways to target them ([1] Sternberg, 2005). Johnson & Johnson decided to exclude advertising agencies altogether to execute a new marketing campaign, going directly to media networks - Time Warner, NBC Universal, Viacom - as a route to new thinking. "Madison Avenue should feel we are looking for more creative solutions," said a J&J executive involved with the recent deal. "We're posting a sign saying we're open to new ideas" ([2] Edwards, 2005). Time Warner won the business.

~~With gathering momentum, the advertising industry is becoming increasingly irrelevant to business strategy. Society has changed. The underlying economics have changed. Business has changed. The information environment has changed. We are in the midst of massive transformation coming at us with a speed and level of intensity that no one has faced before. "I've been in postwar Japan, pre-revolutionary Iraq, worked in China during the Cultural Revolution, and I've never seen a period of such uncertainty," says Pfizer CEO Hank McKinnell[^1] . A very big meteor has crashed and created a new world disorder, and the mammals are separating from the dinosaurs.~~

~~It's no secret the pharmaceutical industry is in an era of transition. Seismic shifts are taking hold across the span of competitive, economic, political, regulatory, and social systems the industry operates in. But as difficult as it is for pharmaceutical manufacturers to find a way to transcend their current environment and begin shaping change rather than becoming a victim of it, they are not alone. Accelerating issues of complexity, commoditization, and industry evolution are confronting the global marketing, music, information technology, automotive, financial services, media, defense, airline, telecommunications, and consumer packaged goods industries.~~

The purpose of this paper is to provide a ==new language== or a ==new context== within which "marketing" can navigate the currents shaping major directional-change in the world. By design it will be a language that clears away the sacred temples that define marketing creativity as emotional bonding to branding and strategy as a function of positioning; their value belongs to an old equilibrium, a set of marketplace assumptions that no longer apply. It does this to construct a different lens from which the marketing industry can view itself, to push the envelope, and to stimulate new thinking about competitive strategy, concepts of operation, and improving marketing performance.

As will become clear, this is a narrative that challenges deeply entrenched views about brands and brand management. Its central premise is that the marketing industry is collapsing into ruinous commoditization, and that "marketing" – the way it is defined, conceptualized, sold, purchased, practiced, and measured – is radically out of sync with new dynamics of competition and complexity. Perhaps most fundamentally, this paper argues that ==instead of a "customer-centric" model==, a =="network-centric"== approach is the more logical frame to launch a fundamental reorientation of the marketing domain.

### New dynamics of competition and complexity

Globalization has changed the perception we had of the world in the late twentieth century and the strategic context for business. But globalization isn't about opening offices in Beijing and Mumbai. At its core, ==globalization== is about a ==new operating theory== of the world based on ==connectedness among pre-existing political, social, economic, thematic, and geographic boundaries==. It is this connectedness, and its complexity, which is increasingly a source of instability, risk, and a virtual tidal wave of change. It is also driving an accelerating reorganization of the global economic landscape into business networks, motivating the development of fresh approaches to complex problem situations in a way that brings ideas, partners, and customers together ([3] Moore, 1996).

In a robustly-networked world, the operating environment for business is more and more outside the control of any one organization. The explosion in the reach and penetration of information technologies is causing linkages to form – both good and bad – that consist of many interacting components, nodes, and layers co-evolving and aggregating with each other and their environments in new ways. These intricate relationships give rise to multiple networks of dependencies and cascading effects, or emergent behaviors within networks of networks and systems of systems ([4] Department of Defense Command and Control Research Project, 1999). We cannot ignore complexity and we cannot prevent the linkages from forming. They dramatically impact business models and organizations, and in so doing redefine what has value, enhancing the value of some capabilities that are a better response to the emerging environment, and devaluing others. Advertising has adapted to this connectivity by proliferating in as many new media channels as possible. The big problem is that the adaptation has been to a deteriorating environment, and savvy consumers either "skip this ad" or are no longer willing to pay a premium for a fancy nameplate attached to an otherwise generic product. Put another way, there is ==rapidly diminishing value from== pumping out more or different "==branding==" as a creative response to shifting paradigms and product proliferation.

The dynamics of information production, dissemination, storage, display, and retrieval have changed radically, and significant amounts of information are produced and obtained outside of an organization. As the cost of processing and communications power has tumbled, it has become cost-effective for organizations and individuals to adopt and utilize information technologies in more and more situations. So what was once a highly constrained and vertical information flow has evolved to a torrent of vertical and horizontal flows pushed and pulled from a galaxy of sources, both on- and off-line ([5] National Defense University, 1996). The issues associated with information glut, including the increased potential for overload, second-guessing, micro-management, and distraction, are critical business and societal challenges, particularly in the public health arena[^2] (see Figure 1 [Figure omitted. See Article Image.]).

==The connections and interactions can be so intense and transformative that we can no longer distinguish between actors and their environments==, let alone say much about any piece in isolation. Whereas previously it was possible to separate customer from competitor and analyze the performance of individual pieces, advances in telecommunication have linked the information and economic domains of customer, competitor and collaborator as never before. Assuming all players have access to virtually the same information and information technologies and can therefore equally "target" a demographic with precision, ==there is no competitive advantage in a digital marketing capability that targets consumers with promotion==, regardless of how deep it can reach to personalize. Everyone already has the capability to promote at the subatomic level, and is generally doing so, going head-to-head with all the other "one-to-one" marketing programs from all players in all industries.

It will yield little novelty, and only marginal incremental value, when every brand team in every product and service category – restaurants, automobile dealerships, hospitals, florists, pharmacies, computer makers, accountants, department stores – decides, for example, to leverage global positioning systems in cell phones to tailor a three-second promotional message to a consumer based on location ([6] Richtel, 2006). The problem with micro-targeting as a strategy-making philosophy is that it consistently trails technological innovation. It's reactive to the latest wrinkle in information-distribution and completely ignores the complex networked environment in which the brand, customer, and business reside. Adopting technological innovation needs to be replaced by a broader integrative vision to produce order out of chaos.

Rather than replicating what already exists or trying to squeeze more life out of a worn-out paradigm, marketing creativity should center on developing the skills to build and manage an environment of changes and opportunities simultaneously. The only sensible way to compete is by being ==better than your rivals at molding new marketing ecosystems==, not just products and pieces, and from being able to ==steer ecosystems to lasting growth== ([3] Moore, 1996). Instead of brand, the marketing ecosystem becomes the primary unit for strategy-making, the thing that gets assembled, deployed, managed, measured, embedded in the marketplace, and evolved to accommodate more and more components. A general conclusion is that by ==connecting even simple components *in the right way* , complex problems beyond the abilities of individual components are solvable==, and new capabilities are acquired.

### New forms of strategy and management

Business conditions have become fluid and unfamiliar. Perhaps the most significant effect of this has to do with how companies organize, operate, and think about themselves. Big winners adapting to this new environment tend to shift their view of actors as independent to viewing them as part of complex adaptive systems[^3] . It's a change in perspective with implications for strategy and operations. ==Success will now be determined by shaping the *combined behavior* of large and interconnected networks== of companies, products, and suppliers, and playing a role in developing their capabilities, supporting their innovation, and having a say in their choices of relationships within industry ecosystems ([8] Iansiti and Levien, 2004a). The network becomes much more than the sum of its parts. This stems from a systems concept called emergence and emergent properties, in which the attributes of any part in isolation are not the same as when they are interacting with others in a whole ([9] Capra, 1996). The system creates its own potential.

Making strategic choices to compete between and within ecosystems is now an increasing focus for competitive strategy. Companies are ==shifting their strategies== from the management of internal resources ==to the management and influence of assets that are outside their direct ownership== and control. Leading players in this climate are transforming themselves to serve (and sell) the many ecosystems in which they operate. ~~Wal-Mart Stores and Microsoft are two dominators that continually gain new capabilities, innovation, and competitive advantage from a strategic vision centered on value-sharing within business ecosystems: Wal-Mart, which sees itself not as a retailer but as an information management company, has created a system for managing inventory where supply-chain information is packaged and distributed to its business partners as part of a corporate philosophy of knowledge-sharing about inventory, logistics, and detailed financial information; the Microsoft Developer Network is a cornerstone to its business model, which places a premium on encouraging developers to write applications for the Windows platform, with cascading effects throughout the computing industry ([10] Iansiti and Levien, 2004b). Time Warner leveraged a network-centric approach that gave them a decisive competitive advantage with J&J. AT&T completely re-launched itself in 4Q2005 with a growth strategy based on total system leadership, betting heavily on being able to create and deliver a network of content through television, wireless phones, and computers ([11] Grant and Latour, 2005). And as part of its just-announced turnaround plan, Merck is initiating a network-centric strategy to develop new approaches to manufacturing, marketing, and sales[^4] .~~

Time, or operating tempo, has increased in importance. Agile firms use superior marketspace awareness to sense and respond to changes in their operating environment, shorten the time between new business ideas and capital investment, and to design and deploy instant business teams. They accomplish this through self-synchronization - managers at the edge of operations are empowered to make decisions without prior approval and by sharing information with their peers. As data is divorced from its source and pushed out to the field, shared awareness within the system occurs, so when new sources of information arise, others who might benefit can be alerted quickly. Management intent is to shape an environment where innovation arises from bringing different perspectives to bear on "information content" for creative problem solving. Interoperation also reflects how different organizations, at certain times and places, can collaborate on new ways of working together and develop and deploy new sources of power - innovations, capabilities, solutions - in the marketplace

It's worth keeping in mind that "network-centric" is a *concept of operation* . It represents a new way of thinking about simplifying complexity. It has little to do with technology per se; the networks and systems are, in fact, more about a new variety of creativity, interfaces between different people and different businesses, culture and behavior that value knowledge-sharing as a springboard to collaborative innovation, coordinating an environment of connections and interactions with the marketplace, and new forms of interoperation that can adapt quickly to a variety of situations. These concepts ==focus on interrelationships rather than things==, identifying ==patterns of change== instead of static snapshots taken at a particular moment in time, and on the behavior of connected wholes rather than separate parts. And these are common themes and co-occurrences - the same forces and events - driving new organizational frameworks across disciplines, industries, geographies, business units, economies, peoples, and technologies. A major issue in the information age is keeping up with the pace of technology change. With new information-related capabilities becoming available so quickly, how can we possibly learn to effectively use them before they, in turn, become obsolete? The answer lies in a strategy that anticipates, rather than trails, technology. Here, too, this approach is concept-driven rather than technology-driven ([12] Department of Defense Command and Control Research Program, 2002).

All of which brings us back to the marketing domain.

### Concept-driven marketing innovation

~~People have an innate sense for detecting when rule sets are out of whack, or for when all the procedures and ways of working seem built for one type of environment, and you suddenly find yourself dealing with something completely different. The global advertising and marketing community is now confronting this reality. Many marketing firms and departments have a siege mentality arising from pressure from all corners to upgrade their strategic thinking and provide whole new kinds of creative solutions ([13] Wasserman and Edwards, 2005). The move by Johnson & Johnson to pursue a network-centric concept with Time Warner is one reminder of how the rules of the game are changing. It promises to be a watershed event ([14] McClellan and McCains, 2005).~~

~~There has been a rapid succession of body blows to the consensus of what constitutes marketing creativity and strategy. In response, the advertising industry is beginning to stir: rewarding agency executives who can sell and manage aggregated business units is one example, as is the growing attention from major holding companies to realms outside of traditional advertising ([15] Elliot, 2005; [16] Vranica, 2005). The bigger question is whether these moves will yield characteristics and capability packages - new forms of creativity driven by thinking that goes beyond traditional boundaries - in demand by the marketplace, or is it simply incrementalism from a "brand and promote" sphere of conceptualization. Until marketers can find a way to close the conceptual gap between a "promote and push" mindset and a world being transformed by system-level competition and the dynamics of connectivity from globalization, the fundamental strategic mismatch between marketing and business strategy will remain. This may partly explain why the career life expectancy of the average Chief Marketing Officer is less than two years (see Table I [Figure omitted. See Article Image.]).~~

"The threat [to the agencies] is if [they] don't look at the model and explore new forms of connection and collaboration," says the Johnson & Johnson executive. How do we set up for concept-driven innovation? There is no mystery here. ==Marketing-concept innovation will come from tying together previously disconnected elements and new thinking systems==, not dabbling in micro-media technology, podcasts, or searching for breakthrough advertising. Insights that require a new perspective, a missing fact, or a different tool set will remain undiscovered until someone or some team brings everything together and conducts a pilot. A roadmap is essential to foster concept innovation and new business models in line with information age business strategies (see Figure 2 [Figure omitted. See Article Image.])**.** A distinction also needs to be made between sustaining and disruptive innovation; transformation favors disruptive innovation. The right organizational form and climate need to be created to improve the reach of collaboration - a prerequisite are incentives for risk-taking and a strategy for experimentation and change that strikes the right balance between risk and reward.

==Innovation is becoming less about fundamental discovery and more about the art of leveraging the ecosystem to integrate established capabilities with new opportunities== ([10] Iansiti and Levien, 2004b). It reflects how management and leadership of a networked operating environment are approached, and how information is shared throughout the business ecosystem. Ongoing professional development must encourage genre-hopping experiences and exposure to different ways of thinking to drive imagination. Constraints on information sharing, interactions, and the way assets are deployed need to be identified and removed. But clearly the first order of business is to recognize that change is needed.

### A fresh creative response

~~History is replete with examples of changed environments that were recognized too late for an institution to successfully adapt. Even when institutions recognize the changes, they may be unwilling or unable to adapt to new conditions. The age we live in demands marketing characterized by radically new thinking, new tactics, new organizations managed by committed leadership and enabled by state-of-the art information capabilities.~~

Complexity, globalization, information age concepts of operation, system-level competition, and agility are big strategic themes changing the nature of business today, and they are driving marketplace demand for a fundamental change in the process for creativity. The challenge to the marketing industry is responding to avoid strategic irrelevance and commoditization. The dynamics of change are such that we will forever be in transition. Our success as individuals, families, organizations, communities, and societies will depend more than ever upon our abilities to adapt, in near real time, to deal with the increasingly complex and dynamic situations that will be the defining characteristics of the Information Age. The need to move, and move quickly, should be a priority.
