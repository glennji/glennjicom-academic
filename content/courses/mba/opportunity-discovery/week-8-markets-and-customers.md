>After last weekâ€™s presentation we move our focus to 'going out of the building', testing the problem as well as the solution. For that we will introduce the concept of prototyping and the need to not only test your value proposition but also your business model. We start with the minimum requirements for your financial part of the canvas and will introduce a market (niche) strategy, including ways to cross the chasm. The chasm is a fascinating and important phenomenon in customer behaviour. For example, when you encounter the chasm, it would be interesting to ask yourself where exactly you locate yourself as a consumer of new technologies.

>In innovation, the process follows diverging and converging cycles and you should never be happy with your current concept unless you have clear indication of your product-market fit. Best proof of that is repeated sales.

# This week's objectives
By the end of this week you should be able to:

  - apply the technology adoption lifecycle as a solution model
  - analyse how the lean startup methodology is a successful approach to business planning.
