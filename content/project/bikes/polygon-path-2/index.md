 The Polygon Path 2 Disc is purposely build for the urban environment, where speed, agility, weight and comfort are paramount for the discerning rider.

The ALX Alloy frame on the Path 2 Disc is formed using a process called "hydroforming" which gives each individual tube on the frame a specific shape and eliminates any excess unwanted material which results in a very light weight frame. This type of frame is generally seen on more expensive bikes in the market. The bike is constructed using a geometry that provides a slightly more upright riding position - allowing the rider to easily view upcoming obstacles or traffic.

The fork on the bike is now also made from Aluminium, this reduced the overall weight of the bike compared with typical steel or cromoly forks.

Of course, should you want, there are rack mounts on the frame – suitable for mounting luggage racks or babyseats.

With the new upgraded brake system, the Path 2 Disc is now much easier and manageable thanks to the well-known benefits of Disc Brake technology. Disc Brakes separate the rim from the brake surface, so that any of the usual pulsation and surging you get from typical rim brakes is eradicated. Instead the braking performance is smooth and consistent no matter what the weather conditions.

A 24 speed Shimano Altus / Tourney group set provides the Path 2 Disc with ample gear range to conquer any hill around town. Large 29"wheels with city-specific tyres mounted on double wall alloy rims give this bike plenty of grip at all times – you’ll feel comfortable and in control even whilst cycling at speed.

Completing the Path 2 is an Alloy stem, handlebar and seat post including a super popular, ergonomic Entity saddle
