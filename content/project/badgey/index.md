Just imagine if you could gamify "adulting" ...

I've noticed that I'm a bit of a sucker for a "badge" — some online representation of an achievement or challenge — in that it drives my behaviour such that I will do things for the sake of the badge rather than for any merit the act may have. For example, I've got a lot of badges on Untappd, and I'm more likely to drink craft beer because of it, even tho' it runs counter to my goal of becoming hyperfit.

So what if I could trick myself into _positive_ behaviours instead? Sure, fitness apps will give "distance run", "fasts undertaken", "kilograms lifted", but each of those lives in its own little bubble universe. What we need, then, is some system that is able to access these trackers and "steal"/copy the badges from each of them ... and any others I might want to create.

Even better, what if the system allowed individuals to craft their **own** badges, based on criteria they invented? Wouldn't that be cool?

e.g. badges (and integrations)

* Distance moved (Google Fit, Apple, Garmin)
* Calories/carbs ingested (My Fitness Pal, Google Fit)
* Lines of code contributed (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket)
* Sleep improvements made (Oura, Sleep As Android)
* New songs listened to (Spotify, Google Music, Apple Music, Last.fm)
* Books read (Goodreads, All Consuming)
* Words written (Wordpress, RSS, Medium)
* Posts made (Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)
* Hours offline (Facebook, Twitter, Insta)
* Every Day I'm Hustlin' (number of new jobs, LinkedIn)

But also "once off achievements" and/or non-integration based stuff:

* Replicator (had a child)
* World Traveller (how many places)
* ...
