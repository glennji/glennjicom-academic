GK61 from 极客定制 (_ji ke ding zhi_?) is a 60% keyboard with hot-swappable switches and a custom firmware. It's my first "Alibaba"
keyboard purchase, and I really do like it, although I miss having Fn keys (and will likely buy something that includes
them next). I capped Kailh red switches with some front-printed Cherry-profile keys, switched off most of the RGB glow,
and use it to hack Python and other things on a Macbook Pro via a USB cable.

Sadly, it's not QMK-compatible, but there is [an opensource utility](https://github.com/pixeltris/GK6X) for 
configuring layers and lighting which I'm yet to try.
