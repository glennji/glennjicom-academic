## Mechanical keyboards
As the primary user interface for many generations of computer users, the humble keyboard surely deserves its place in 
the history books as one of the twentieth century’s greatest inventions. From the surface, at least, it appears to be 
largely unchanged since the electric typewriter of the ’30s, with the layout even older still — a lattice of switches 
which, when closed, send an appropriate electrical signal to the computing device — and as a frequent, heavy computer 
user, I should probably have paid more attention.

Of course, no invention is safe from innovation and human ingenuity. In the last couple of years, I've become 
interested in mechanical keyboards as a [hobby](/notes/hobbies/): building them, swapping components, and learning new 
layouts. Below you can find some details about the keyboards or kits I currently have.
