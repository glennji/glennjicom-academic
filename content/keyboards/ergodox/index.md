An opensource DIY keyboard originally developed by `dox`, featuring a split, ergonomic layout and QMK support. 80 (or 
so) keys, USB, customisable like few keebs. I bought a kit and starting building with Mina at Domain, but it has
languished in a drawer since then. Maybe when we find our next rental property I'll be able to setup a soldering
station and actually finish some stuff?
