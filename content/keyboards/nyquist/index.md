  The name Nyquist comes from the Nyquist sampling theorem, which says that if you want to sample a signal to convert it from analog to digital and be able to uniquely reconstruct the signal later, then the sample rate has to be twice the bandwidth of the signal. So here, if you want to sample this PCB, you're going to need 2 of them.

The Nyquist is a 60% split ortholinear powered by an on-board controller (ATmega32u4) with DFU bootloader and USB-C port. Each half of the board is a 5x6 matrix, but there is the option to have a 2u key in the lower left and right corners in place of 2 1u keys. The spot for the 2u has holes for Cherry PCB mounted stabilizers.
