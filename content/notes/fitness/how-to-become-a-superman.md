I'm a hacker and scientist on a mission: to change my body composition from &gt; 30% body-fat to a lean, mean living machine. My genetics seem favourable: I put on fat quickly, but I put on muscle relatively easily too -- so I just need to form habits and patterns that will support the latter rather than the former.
That, and to achieve immortality.

I have a strong desire to **not die** and therefore wish to reach my best: the peak potential that my corporeal state can achieve, starting from here and working for the rest of my (hopefully extended) life.
And, as is the case with a lot of my goals, it feels like one of my primary drivers is "because it's hard". In short, I want to *perfect the temple* through exercise and diet just to prove (to myself, or others?) that I can. I want to be hyperfit.


I mean more than just regular healthy-levels -- the kind of fitness that marathon runners have, or professional sports-people, or the kinds of people that cycle across Africa. Like, *scary fit*.

Why become hyperfit? (Bruce Lee says train for a reason. So what is your reason?)

 - I can play with Jules now and see him grow to adulthood
 - To live long enough to achieve LEV (immortality)
 - I can enjoy doing the Things I Like Doing!
 - To enjoying trying all the things I'd like to try
 - I have to consider my brain my biggest asset -- it pays the bills -- and a healthy body supports a healthy mind. There is no point practising relaxation and single-pointed focus if my body won't support it, so now is the time.
 - For the pure addictive challenge of self-improvement and biohacking



<h4>Inspiration</h4>

 - IRL:

 - Tim Ferriss: for experiments in biohacking; how much control do we really have?
 - Bruce Lee: for an incredible physique built by applied science.
 - R. Buckminster Fuller: for showing the value of unconventional thinking


 - Archetypes:

 - Tony Stark: Techno-maker genius with a superhero physique
 - Sherlock Holmes: A gentleman and a scholar. Logic personified.
 - Jedi Master Yoda: Martial and spiritual excellence.



=== How?
Okay, so I have my motivation down -- how am I going to achieve it? Well, after a few years of experiments (see below), I'm currently settled on the following:

 - Ketogenic diet
 - Intermittent fasting (Bulletproof®)
 - Cold thermogenesis (i.e. the Wim Hof Method)
 - Supplements
 - Organic, unprocessed &amp; ethical goods and superfoods
 - Daily Exercise: Running, martial-arts and the gym
 - ...?

=== Experiments
Taking a scientific approach to modern life seems rational: the world is changing far too quickly for "old rules" to apply without discrimination, and discriminative consideration requires logic and intellect. There are quite a number of different "life experiments" I can (and have) run on myself. I marked with a checkmark those things I've tried and am keeping.
