After four decades on this planet, two of which I've been solely responsible for choosing what to eat, I still don't know exactlyÂ <em>what</em> to feed myself for the best outcomes: athletic performance, appropriate weight, sleep, digestion and cognitive function. Why is this so hard for so many?
This is my next experiment [icon name="heartbeat" class="" unprefixed_class=""]:
<ol>
 	<li>Less animal protein (100g a day maximum and take a day off sometimes!)</li>
 	<li>Much less dairy (just greek-style yoghurt, some cheese)</li>
 	<li>No added sugar (nothing too processed)</li>
 	<li>Raw fruit first thing after a fast</li>
 	<li>Leafy greens and beans for the main midday meal</li>
</ol>
