Research these:
<ul>
 	<li>chia</li>
 	<li>goji berries</li>
 	<li>ginger - digestive aid?</li>
 	<li>"evergreen", pine-nuts (??) -- pycnogenol as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and can cross the blood-brain barrier.</li>
 	<li>garlic - allicin has a bunch of properties</li>
</ul>
<h3>And let's talk about wine</h3>
There are (<a href="http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/diet/13-reasons-you-need-to-drink-more-wine/news-story/516e98b251b1745a61da2a6bdbc1e868">potentially</a>) a lot of benefits to (moderate consumption of) wine, including:
<ul>
 	<li>lower risk of:
<ul>
 	<li>dementia</li>
 	<li>liver disease</li>
 	<li>prostate, bowel, lung &amp; breast cancer</li>
 	<li>diabetes</li>
 	<li>blindness</li>
 	<li>depression</li>
 	<li>heart disease</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>protection from:
<ul>
 	<li>sunburn</li>
 	<li>ageing</li>
 	<li>stroke damage</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
It's enough to make me want a glass <em>now</em>, to be honest.
And if I'm on that bandwagon, how about I google "health benefits of coffee" and "health benefits of whisky".
<h3>Health benefits of whisky</h3>
Regular, moderate consumption of whisky may have similar benefits to wine:
<ul>
 	<li>prevention of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1489648/Whisky-helps-fight-cancer.html">cancer</a></li>
 	<li>an increase in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9805220">antioxidants</a></li>
 	<li>making one look like a <em>seriously cool dude</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Health benefits of coffee</h3>
For another day.
