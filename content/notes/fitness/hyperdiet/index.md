After four decades on this planet, two of which I've been solely responsible for choosing what to eat, I still don't know exactlyÂ <em>what</em> to feed myself for the best outcomes: athletic performance, appropriate weight, sleep, digestion and cognitive function. Why is this so hard, for me and so many others?
This is my next experiment:

1. Reduce animal protein (and read up on veganism)
2. Skip dairy, especially anything with lactose in it
3. No added sugar
4. Increase leafy greens
5. Intermittent Fasting (OMAD)



## Hacking nutrition

e.g.

* Four Hour Body
* PAGG
* Cissus Quadrangularis



Research:

* creatine
* glutamine
* essential fatty acids (EFAs)
* alpha-lipids



Books:

* How To Eat *(Mark Bittman & David Katz)*
* The Warrior Diet
