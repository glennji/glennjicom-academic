<i>So the basic idea is that we're all poisoned by daily life, and that these fat-soluble poisons mess with our metabolisms very directly, by screwing with mitochondrial function. The trick, then, is to detox AND to avoid new toxins - which makes our systems run at peak efficiency, and we become naturally lean and energetic. Nice idea!</i>
Rules:
<ul>
 	<li>organic everything</li>
 	<li>no instant coffee &#x1f641;</li>
 	<li>light on fruit</li>
 	<li>high on vegetables</li>
 	<li>high on organic animal protein</li>
</ul>
<b>Broccoli &amp; Green Tea</b>
When it comes to helping the liver properly process chemicals in the blood, the two most powerful foods are green tea and broccoli (and its brassica cousins: cauliflower, brussels sprouts, cabbage, and kale). Broccoli boosts the enzymes that help move caffeine and some airborne pollutants out of our blood, and it boosts glutathione function, which helps usher out toxins such as pesticides and solvents. Eat broccoli raw or juiced for peak benefits, or use broccoli sprouts on your salad — they have the highest levels of these beneficial chemicals. Beyond broccoli and other brassicas, great choices with similar properties are beets and  liberal amounts of turmeric, ginger, and rosemary.
