<h4><b>Tools</b></h4>
"Tools" are artifacts that are wielded by humans for a particular purpose (human augmentation). Tools can be categorised in a multitude of ways -- complexity, function, body-integration -- and their use augments us, creating new or enhanced capabilities. Tool-use is the biggest differential between humans and other species, although some other apes show rudimentary tool-use.

<ul>
 	<li>Reference/Memory - This website (was Evernote)</li>
 	<li>Todo/Memory - Todoist (was Doit.im)</li>
 	<li>Read Later - Pocket</li>
 	<li>Calendar/Temporality - Google Calendar (was Sunrise)</li>
 	<li>Writing - Scrivener</li>
 	<li>Tracking financials - Moneywell</li>
 	<li>(Deprecated) Workflowy</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Techniques</b></h4>
"Techniques" are forms of human augmentation that don't require tools, only mental constructs i.e. learning.
Some interesting techniques to research:
<ul>
 	<li>physical performance improvements

 	<li>swimming techniques</li>
 	<li>running techniques</li>
</ul>

 	<li>memory hacks</li>
