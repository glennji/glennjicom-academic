**Cranial nerves** are the [nerves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve) that emerge directly from the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain) (including the [brainstem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem)), of which there are conventionally considered twelve pairs. Cranial nerves relay information between the brain and parts of the body, primarily to and from regions of the [head and neck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck), including the [special senses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_senses) of [vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception), [taste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste), [smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction), and [hearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_nerves#cite_note-Gray's2008-1)

The cranial nerves emerge from the [central nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system) above the level of the first vertebrae of the [vertebral column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_nerves#cite_note-Kandel-2) Each cranial nerve is paired and is present on both sides. There are conventionally twelve pairs of cranial nerves, which are described with [Roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) Iâ€“XII. Some considered there to be thirteen pairs of cranial nerves, including [cranial nerve zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_nerve_zero). The numbering of the cranial nerves is based on the order in which they emerge from the brain and brainstem, from front to back.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_nerves#cite_note-Kandel-2)

The [terminal nerves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_nerve) (0), [olfactory nerves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_nerve) (I) and [optic nerves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve) (II) emerge from the [cerebrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum), and the remaining ten pairs arise from the [brainstem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem), which is the lower part of the brain.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_nerves#cite_note-Vilensky-3)

The cranial nerves are considered components of the [peripheral nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system) (PNS),[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_nerves#cite_note-Vilensky-3) although on a structural level the olfactory (I), optic (II), and trigeminal (V) nerves are more accurately considered part of the central nervous system (CNS).[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_nerves#cite_note-4)

The cranial nerves are in contrast to [spinal nerves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_nerve), which emerge from segments of the [spinal cord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord).[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_nerves#cite_note-Vilensky-3)
