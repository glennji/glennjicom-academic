> Continuous Testing is the process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline in order to obtain feedback on the business risks associated with a software release candidate as rapidly as possible. It evolves and extends test automation to address the increased complexity and pace of modern application development and delivery.

A big part of our practice is the design, creation, research and advisement of strategies and platforms for automated testing.

There are many different reasons for, and types of, automated tests. These could include:

- unit tests
- regression testing
- load and performance profiling
- environment readiness ("smoke") tests
- monitoring

These could be run as part of continuous integration, continuous deployment and/or on an adhoc basis.
