"Permaculture" is a set of design principles centered on whole systems thinking, simulating, or directly utilizing the 
patterns and resilient features observed in natural ecosystems, first developed by David Holmgren and Bill Mollison in 
1978. It uses these principles in a growing number of fields from regenerative agriculture, rewilding, and community 
resilience.
