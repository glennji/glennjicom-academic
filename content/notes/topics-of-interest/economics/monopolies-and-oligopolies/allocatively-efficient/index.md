**Allocative efficiency** is an economic concept regarding efficiency at the social or societal level. It refers to producing the optimal quantity of some output, the quantity where the marginal benefit to society of one more unit just equals the marginal cost. The rule of profit maximization in a world of perfect competition was for each firm to produce the quantity of output where P = MC. The price (P) reflects demand, and as such is a measure of how much buyers value the good, while the marginal cost (MC) is a measure of what additional units of output cost society to produce. Following this rule assures allocative efficiency. If P > MC, then the marginal benefit to society (as measured by P) is greater than the marginal cost to society of producing additional units, and a greater quantity should be produced. However, in the case of monopoly, at the profit-maximizing level of output, price is always greater than marginal cost.
