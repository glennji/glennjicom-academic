## Why study economics?
It's a good question, and one I'd like to be able to answer with something better than "it's part of my schoolwork". I do think that understanding more about the forces and principles at play in these critical systems is useful: expanding my mind, informing decisions.  Isn't that the whole point of the MBA?

I'll be studying economics next semester for **ECO80001: Economics**, using G. Mankiw's Principles of Economics as the text book. These notes are an attempt to actually get ahead of the game for once.

- Introduction to economics
- Market supply and demand
- Elasticity
- Production costs and business decisions
- Monopolies and Oligopolies
- Market failures
- Macroeconomics (concepts and measures)
- Aggregate demand - aggregate supply framework
- Fiscal policy
- Money, interest rates and monetary policy
- Long-term economic growth and the exchange rate system

Reading Notes from [The Economy](http://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/0-3-contents.html)

- The capitalist revolution
- Technology, population & growth
- Scarcity, work & choice
- Social interactions
- Property and power (Mutual gains and conflict)

- The labour market: Wages, profits & unemployment
- Banks, money & the credit market
- Rent-seeking, price-setting & market dynamics
- Markets, efficiency and public policy
- ...
