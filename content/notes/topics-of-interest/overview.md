There are a number of topics of interest that I like to read about, research, and consider; if it's something I really, *really* want to learn then I should probably implement some different learning hacks.

Topics of interest include:

  - [entrepreneurship](/categories/entrepreneurship), leadership and opportunity discovery
  - philosophy, psychology and meditation
  - economics and anthropology
  - history, religion/theosophy & alchemy (yes, even alchemy)
  - language
  - science & mathematics
  - medicine

Also, *le topic informatique*:

 - information processing (systems analysis, compression, cryptography)
 - memetics and information society (privacy, ethics, intellectual property)
 - programming & information-processing
 - operating systems
 - human augmentation (& productivity)
 - artificial intelligence
 - cybernetics, human-computer interaction and user experience


Whilst each of these seems to be immensely interconnected (to me), perhaps it is only so in my mind. Nevertheless, it is worth investigating each and "plugging it in" to my particular (peculiar?) neural network.
