Okay, so I'm trying to sell the motorbike, and in fact I'm a little freaked by the idea of having an accident _and abandoning my child_, so it's pretty unlikely that I'm going to be doing any motorcycle-based bugging out any time soon ... but I'll keep this page around until he's all grown up and I've retired[^1].

[^1]: And Tez, if you ever come across this page then let me reiterate that I'm 100% into us having a tour of the Rockies and Canada in general. Just say the word, cuz...

There's a bunch of prep required to have a safe and comfortable moto-based escape/bugout. 

* first-aid essentials/motorcycle kit
 	* <strong>Ibuprofen </strong>(pain and fever reducer, anti-inflammatory)
 	* <strong>Antihistamine (Telfast 180mg) </strong>(allergies, sleep aid)
 	* <strong>Pseudoephedrine </strong>(nasal decongestant, helps with “ear pop” from planes)
 	* <strong>Safety pins</strong> (quick fix for clothing, making an arm sling, emergency cloth)
 	* <strong>Bandana</strong> (sling for arm, dust mask,
 	* <strong>Antiseptic towelettes</strong> (cleaning hands and wounds)
 	* <strong>Electrolyte packets</strong> (for replacing electrolyte loss due to vomiting or diarrhoea)

 	* <strong>4 x 4 gauze pads</strong> (minor cuts and scrapes)
