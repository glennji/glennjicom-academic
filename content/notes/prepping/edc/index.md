The <em>everyday carry</em> are those items you always have with you — keys, wallet, phone — and anything you cart from, say, home to office during the week, such as pens, a laptop, notebook, etc. When people try to <em>design</em> their EDC, it is usually with a view to minimizing "stuff" while maximizing utility or preparing for possible emergency situations.
In my case, I'm trying stop myself from carting every damn thing I own.

## Essentials

- Minimalist wallet with bank cards, ID and access cards, and multitool
- Orbitkey keyring
- Car keys
- Oneplus Five

I don't always wear a watch, but I do like them for some reason.
