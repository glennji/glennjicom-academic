Sure, why not: we have to start somewhere, don't we? These pages, and this 'blog, act as a sort of "commonplace book", with notes and thoughts from a variety of subjects.  It's a form of intelligence amplification modelled on my own neural network. They include a whole bunch of different, interrelated information that could be interesting[^1] and exploring and editing may help me discover new connections and relationships I wouldn't find on my own.

With this latest incarnation[^2], I've finally separated:

  * topics of interest
  * personal development
  * hobbies and things I would like to try
  * thoughts on how to become a superman or bugging out
  * and life, the universe and everything

There's probably also bad fiction, juvenilia and a bunch of just wrong-headed assumptions or half-formed thoughts; it is a personal website after all. *GET OUT OF MY HEAD ALREADY!!!*

[^1]: Well, interesting to *me* anyway.

[^2]: I've been writing and rewriting these notes for a long time, and across media -- from Tomboy on Linux and Windows (although I never could get Macboy working well) to a Tiddlywiki, Workflowy to Evernote and now here. There's lots of lists without context, pages with barely formed thoughts, some content stolen verbatim from Wikipedia. Read on!
