When interviewing, it's important to create a "narrative" that describes you in the best light. This allows your future colleagues to imagine you in their workplace, as well as creating a sense of trust and confidence.

One good technique for compelling interview narratives is the **Challenge Action Result**.

# Challenge
Context setting: talk about the role, the company, and what the challenge was. Include why solving the challenge was something meaningful to do!

# Action
Your hero moment: describe what YOU did, say "I" a lot and feel free to play up your criticality a little. Don't be afraid to brag: if you've set up the challenge successfully, nobody will be wondering why you pursued it with such diligence and focus.

# Result
Now, the payout: pull it all together, describe the impact to the business and/or team, and back it up with data if at all possible (use a KPI that matters to your industry).
