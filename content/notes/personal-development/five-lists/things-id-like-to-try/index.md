In GTD, there is a categoryÂ of tasks and projects that you're not even sure you'd like to progress -- thoughts you can't let go, but haven't dedicated the time to actually unpacking or contemplating any further than "what if ...?". We call this "Someday, Maybe".

Here I'm being a bit more committed than that, and just gathering a list of things I'd like to try:

- Building our dream home
- Travelling the world
  - Living in an awesome Paris apartment
- Opening a bar
  * a microbrewery/boutique beer bar
    + Hopped / Hop'd
    + Ferment / Ferment'd
    + Brew (coffee too) / Brewd / Brew'd
    + The Local Drugstore
- Flying
  * as a first-class passenger
  * as the pilot
- Writing a novel (nanowrimo)
	- Recording a YouTube channel
	- Attending a (mud and camping) music festival
- Prototyping
  - Hacking at the intersection between real and virtual
  - "Enabling" existing devices (like radios, telephones)
  - Building my own future one device at a time
  - motorcycle(s)
    - riding
    - fixing up a classic bike like an Indian, AJS or BSA
- Writing and research (writing ideas)
  - Script improvement service
  - blogging
  - fiction
