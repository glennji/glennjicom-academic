_So on and off I have this idea to set myself challenges, then take whatever concrete steps I can towards them as a way of deciding what it is I actually value, as well as hoping that the training or changes required on the "journey" are ones that will make me a better person regardless of the "destination". But I do need to revise them for 2020._

_They are, I must admit, not in any particular order._

# #1: Achieve Immortality

Okay, I can't do this one on my own, but I certainly can do a bunch of things that might help my longevity, and therefore allow me to still be alive on the day that lady science finally defeats aging — and once we can do that, it's only a matter of time (and careful planning) until we also cure death. Read about this one on my note regarding immortality.

# #2: Get an MBA (become a CTO)

This is kind of in progress (see the [Entrepreneurship](/categories/entrepreneurship) categories, and notes on opportunity discovery) as I'm studying towards an MBA from Swinburne Online. Of course, I'm also hoping our startup finds funding, which would be the fast-track to CTOship — not that the title is all the meaningful to me! But where else can a software developer go?

# #3: Write a book
# #4: Reach my goal weight & fitness

What with a fondness for craft beer, historically poor sleep habits and no real idea on how my body works, I've managed to stack on too much weight to be healthy. In theory, I can shred it off again: see How To Become A Superman.

# #5: Run a marathon
# #6: Build a robot
# #7: Release an app
# #8: Become a true polyglot



# #9: Join MENSA
# #10: Get good at bouldering
# #11: Lucid dream

I've actually had a lucid dream once, and it was pretty amazing: more than just the fact that I knew it was a dream and thus could control it, it was also the most detailed and realistic dream I've ever had: I could feel the woodgrain under my feet, a night-breeze from an open window, the sunshine on my face when I caused dawn with the wave of a hand.

There are plenty of techniques for encouraging lucid dreaming, and I practice a few of them, but so far nothing has repeated the experience. I should probably create a note specifically for lucid dreaming...

# #12: Learn to cook
# #13: ...?
On this review, I couldn't actually think of a full thirteen — either there's no other changes I want in my life right now, or they're things I don't think of as "impossible". (I'm sure I'll think of another one sooner or later, tho'.)
