Kaizen (改善) is Japanese for "improvement", and (in a business context specifically) refers to the act of continuously improving different aspects of a business: processes, methodologies and activities. Here I'm going to attempt to record some of my own practise and success of kaizen, including things taken from Righting the Wrongs:
&nbsp;
From Righting the Wrongs:
<ul>
 	<li>time - I don't have enough "me time".
<ul>
 	<li>Work smarter [icon name="check-square-o" class="" unprefixed_class=""]</li>
 	<li>Accept that some stuff just ain't gonna get done [icon name="check-square-o" class="" unprefixed_class=""]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<em>I've made a conscious effort to embrace these ideas in the last year or so, and to give myself a little more breathing space at work. We took holidays for the first time in a long time at the end of 2016, and it felt great.</em>
<ul>
 	<li>energy - Why am I always so tired?
<ul>
 	<li>hack sleep [icon name="check-square-o" class="" unprefixed_class=""]
<ul>
 	<li>Eyemask? [icon name="check-square-o" class="" unprefixed_class=""]</li>
 	<li>Naps - not viable</li>
 	<li>Alcohol: severely screws up my sleep quality, and totally not worth it [icon name="check-square-o" class="" unprefixed_class=""]</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>get healthier!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<em>I've been getting healthier, keeping very active and not drinking for the last month. I also regularly use an eyemask and headphones (or earplugs) with ambient, meditation or nature sounds. I've also found the energy I get from a ketogenic diet is much, much higher than a carb-fueled one.</em>
<ul>
 	<li>life - Life should be fun.
<ul>
 	<li>having more fun [icon name="check-square-o" class="" unprefixed_class=""]
We're not having a whole lot of fun at the moment. What can we do to actually have some fun and laugh and enjoy life? Part of the problem is that we don't feel ready, prepared. The house is a bit of a shambles at the moment, and that tends to make us both feel overwhelmed; therefore we just want to get AWAY, and we don't think about things that would actually be good to do. Another part is we don't like the way we look: we need to get healthy and tweak our eating habits.
<ul>
 	<li>more active outings on the weekends? e.g. tennis, minigolf. Could we minigolf with Jules?</li>
 	<li>going out for a drink -- again, with Jules? How do we get home? Are there places near Annandale we could wander, then wander home again before it got too late?</li>
 	<li>movies? not very active/participatory</li>
 	<li>the beach? A bit of a drive but could be a fun weekend thing to do as the weather warms up</li>
 	<li>games - boardgames, wii, computer? Things that are competitive, and a couple of glasses of freixnet on the side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<em>This is ongoing. We are definitely making an effort to get out and about more, with swimming every weekend and a few dinners out with friends. That said, it's been great not drinking. Our house is much, much more organised than when I wrote this originally, which definitely helps.</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Lucy
Our (big) puppy dog, Lucifer, is high-maintenance.
<ul>
 	<li>smelly
<ul>
 	<li>regular washes</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>very needy</li>
 	<li>energetic</li>
 	<li>needs to be taken for walks DAILY</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<em>Also ongoing -- we have a few better systems for Lu, including single feed and no "grazing" (this alone has reduced the flies, cockroaches and birds). She still needs a wash, and a walk, but that's Dee's thing -- for my part, I'm picking up after her immediately.</em>
