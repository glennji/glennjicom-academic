> **It's decided**: we're (eventually) going to build an eco farm-stay (and remote business, either "Hack Street" or execi) on the Otway Coast along the Great Ocean Road in southern Victoria.

Places we've lived, and loved:

 - on the outskirts of Melbourne?
 - Inner-west Sydney?

Ideas for another lifetime:

 - in the Southern Highlands of NSW?
 - Orange?
 - Mansfield?
 - a holiday house in Noosa?
 - an apartment in Paris?
 - South of France?
 - on Mars?
