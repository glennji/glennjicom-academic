(Part of: What Future Do You Want?)

I've really got to figure out how I should be spending my time -- what things I'd like to try, the things I like doing, ways to diversify income and how I might make the world a better place. Even if I can achieve immortality (and there's no guarantees), time is one thing we can't recycle.

So how do I want to spend it?

  * writing software that makes a positive difference
  * personal development
  * running
  * meditation
  * [projects](/projects)
  * some hobbies
  * watching TV and Music I Like
  * building a business or two (see online business models)
