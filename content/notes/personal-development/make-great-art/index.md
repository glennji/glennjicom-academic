In 2012, Neil Gaiman gave a speech to the graduating class of art students at the University of Philadelphia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plWexCID-kA

It's a pretty inspiring piece, with a lot of great advice and big ideas. I'm putting down some notes as a personal reminder:

Getting started

 - When you get started, you know nothing. This is good. If you don't know what is "impossible", it's harder to fail/easier to do the impossible. (Or even thirteen impossible things?)
 - Make your end-state desire a distant mountain. Every time you need to decide between two paths, or just pickÂ <em>the next thing</em> to do, make sure it is a step towards the mountain.
 - Make your own art. You may start by sounding like a lot of different people -- that's good -- but eventually you will find your own voice and message. This is the uniqueness that you bring to reality. Nobody else can make your art.
 - Making art is like sending out messages in bottles. Maybe one in a thousand will come back to you.
 - Don't do it for the money, because if the money falls through at least you'll have the art.
 - When you start to feel over-exposed, vunerable -- that's where you start making your own art.

And advice for keeping work? There are three things you can be:

 * a pleasure to work with;
 * someone who does good work;
 * someone who delivers work on time.

Pick two.
