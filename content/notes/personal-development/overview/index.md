# Personal Development Plan

## Where do you want to be (and why)

_One month, six months, a year, five years..._

## Skills needed

_Do you need certain skills to get a particular job or career? Are you planning on living abroad? Have you been told you lack certain skills?_

## Standard to achieve, and how it differs from your current standard

_For each skill you wish to develop ... what level of expertise, aptitude or fluency do you actually need?_

## Priority for each area of improvement

_You can't do it all at once._

## How to progress for each skill or area

_An actionable plan for each skill to be developed._

# Personal SWOT analysis

    Among other things, personal development may include the following activities:

     - improving self-awareness
     - improving self-knowledge
     - improving skills and/or learning new ones
     - building or renewing identity/self-esteem
     - developing strengths or talents
     - improving a career
     - identifying or improving potential
     - building employability or (alternatively) human capital
     - enhancing lifestyle and/or the quality of life and time-management
     - improving health
     - improving wealth or social status
     - fulfilling aspirations
     - initiating a life enterprise
     - defining and executing personal development plans (PDPs)
     - improving social relations or emotional intelligence
     - spiritual identity development and recognition

    Personal development can also include developing other people. This may take place through roles such as those of a teacher or mentor, either through a personal competency (such as the alleged skill of certain managers in developing the potential of employees) or through a professional service (such as providing training, assessment or coaching).
