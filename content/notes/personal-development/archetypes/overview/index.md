We all need heroes (from Greek ἥρως, "warrior, defender, protector"), right? Or maybe it's just me.
I know I certainly appreciate having fellow sentient creatures -- real or imaginary, alive or dead -- to look up to, learn from and attempt to emulate. Of course, real people are complex and complicated, and any mental representation of them we have is necessarily an abstraction.
I call these abstractions "archetypes", and I have selected a handful of whom have several admirable qualities I'd like to develop:
<ul>
 	<li>Tony Stark</li>
 	<li>R. Buckminster Fuller</li>
 	<li>Bruce Lee</li>
 	<li>Sherlock Holmes</li>
 	<li>Jason Bourne</li>
</ul>
By using this term, I'm forced to recognise that my abstractions are not perfect representations of the real people underneath. This helps to avoid any unhealthy "hero worship" and avoid feelings of jealousy and avarice that might otherwise arise.
