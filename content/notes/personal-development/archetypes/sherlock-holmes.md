Sherlock Holmes is a character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in a series of short stories and novels written between 1887 and 1927. In the stories, Holmes is a "consulting detective", whose keen eye and hard logic lead to astounding deductions (or abductions). Since the original stories, he has been portrayed in a number of movies and fiction -- he is often considered the "most well known detective" in the world, despite being fictional.

There are a few characteristics of Sherlock Holmes which make him an interesting archetype to model oneself upon, as a means to self-improvement. In the following lists, I consider the (fictional) man, as well as some challenges and milestones I can use in order to measure how well I can emulate him.
