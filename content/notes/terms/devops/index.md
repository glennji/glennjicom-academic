> *"DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function."* ([What Is DevOps?](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/), AWS)

This practice intends to promote ***DevOps culture & thinking\*** and ***c\**loud-computing expertise\*** across the entire organisation and to champion these with our clients by the design and delivery of supportable, resilient, scalable and high-performance tools, processes and platforms for operations.
