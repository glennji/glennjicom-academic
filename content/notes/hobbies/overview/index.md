I'm terrible at making time for non-directed research, play and practise -- aka "hobbies". There are a bunch of things I'd like to try, however:

* games
* robotics
* music
  * writing/creating
  * playing
* running
  * London marathon
  * Edinburgh marathon
  * triathlon
  * Ironman
  * Kokoda trail
* cycling
  * activities
    * family tour
    * adventure triathlon
* ham radio
* astronomy
