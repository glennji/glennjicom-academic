I'm terrible at making time for non-directed research, play and practise -- aka "hobbies". There are a bunch of things I'd like to try, however:

* games we play
* electronics/robotics
* music
 * writing/creating
 * playing
* running
 * events
  * London marathon
  * Edinburgh marathon
  * triathlon
  * Ironman
  * Kokoda trail
* cycling
 * activities
  * family tour
  * adventure triathlon
 * get bike shipped from Bendigo
* ham radio
* astronomy
* minatures (hobby modelling and painting)
