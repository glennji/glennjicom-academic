Ever since I was a boy (of about 12?) I've been a little obsessed with motorbikes: from Harley-Davidson posters on my bedroom walls, to an ongoing love affair with classic Ducatis, flings with sportsbikes (Yamaha R1 anyone?) and most recently an admiration for the BMW K-series.
When we build our dream house, I'm going to have a motorcycle workshop. In the meantime, Albany Road has a double garage that will do just fine -- as soon as I clear out the stuff we're selling!
