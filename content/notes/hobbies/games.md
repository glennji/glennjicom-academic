I like playing all sorts of games, even if I don't seem to find much time for playing them at the moment: board games, cards, table-top war games and video games alike. Of course, once we move into the Hack Street office I will have access to the Ultimate Arcade Machine.

Games I consider "good" often combine different aspects, such as intellectual or coordination challenges, imagination and escapism. This page attempts to list the games I like playing, or things I would like to try, and serves as a mental reminder in case I find myself at a loss on a Friday or Saturday night.
