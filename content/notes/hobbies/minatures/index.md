This is one of those hobbies (things I'd like to try). I've just bought the Dead Zone box and a couple of basic tools, so I can actually start doing some of this.
<ul>
 	<li>Creating small figurines from base model pieces and modelling putty, then painting them. Â I have an idea for a cool chess set: daemonic Nazis versus cybernetic Soviets. Apart from that, it would be nice to try to create a couple of WH40K armies for "family games night".</li>
</ul>
