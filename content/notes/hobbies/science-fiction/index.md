Ah, this would be my guilty pleasure, if I felt any guilt at reading and watching so much sci-fi. But I don't, and neither should you!

Science-fiction is such a hugely imaginative genre that it feels like it can go on forever (or until the heat-death of this Universe, or the next if we manage to map through to it, or reverse heat-death, or simulate ourselves with ever-faster processing such that it _seems_ like forever to us, or ... you see why I like it?). Robots, space operas, endless wars or virtual paradises â€” it's all possible in a science-fiction story.
