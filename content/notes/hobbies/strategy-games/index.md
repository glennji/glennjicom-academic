War games are a good way to develop strategic thinking, something which I need some practise at (I believe). I've tried a few computer war simulations (both RTS and TBS) and would like to play more; there are also "table-top" war games played with little plastic models called "minatures", or cards and maps (e.g. Risk).

<h2>RTS</h2>
Real-time strategy. These often come down to resource-management (or micro-management) and knowing a bunch of keyboard shortcuts.

<h2>TBS</h2>
Turn-based strategy games include the table-top war games (Warhammer, WH40K) and some computer games.
