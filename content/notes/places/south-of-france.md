"We've always wanted to live in the south of France," we exclaim, whether it's actually true or not. Certainly we loved our short visits to Paris, and <em>sur le papier</em> owning (running?) a manor-house in the French countryside sounds lovely -- but would it really be as idyllic as <em>l'idée</em>?

We have some contacts -- our landlords from inner-west Sydney -- who seem to have made the transition, but we're not quite friends with them, exactly. Still, perhaps we'll try it one day?
