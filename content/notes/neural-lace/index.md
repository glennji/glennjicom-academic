A neural lace is an ultra-thin mesh of electrodes which can be implanted in, or otherwise delivered to, living 
biological tissue. It can then be used for monitoring and/or electrical signalling, which the most commonly cited use 
being the creation of a brain-machine interface by the reading and stimulation of individual neurons via a 3D mesh 
embedded within the brain. Several companies are working on lace technology, including Elon Musk's _Neuralink_.
