>_Ah, Motorcycles, how I love thee. I've got a few ideas about my motorbike restoration job, and have decided that I need to separate "planning" from "action" -- so here is the dreamline, whilst the build log can live elsewhere in the projects space<._

Some time ago, I bought a 1990 BMW K100LT for a bit of a camping tour down south, culminating in a weekend at the MotoGP on Philip Island. It was fun, the bike ran well, but I couldn't help but wonder about doing a restoration/conversion on it...

I imagined the "Kafe Tourer": a stripped back cafe-racer minimal fairing, round headlight, hand-stitched flat leather seat, colour-matching hard panniers, pipe-wrap, immaculately detailed engine block. Of course, I didn't do anything about it (beyond research) and haven't been able to justify the time and money required to pull such a thing off, but I live in hope!

## Next Actions

 * [X] update the project page
 * [ ] oil change
 * [ ] clean
 * [ ] plan

## Ideas
### Rolling gear
 * ...?

### Travel
 * hand-stitched seat
 * matching hard panniers
 * chromed rear rack
 * maybe a little hipster pipe-wrap

### Technology

 * Orientation/lean/acceleration sensor(s)
   * e.g. https://littlebirdelectronics.com
 * twin (3d) fisheye cameras
 * audio pickup (under seat)
 * GPS
 * telemetry: gears, speedometer, odometer, tachometer
 * brake and throttle sensors
 * “traffic cam”
 * HUD in fairing:
   * satnav, speedo, gear indicator, tacho
 * keyless start
 * biometrics: HR, breathing, temperature, etc.
