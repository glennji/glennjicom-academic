We've just bought a couple of bikes, and will be trying to get into riding as a hobby, exercise and way to stay sane while in isolation. I'm in the "3-day monk" phase right now and actively trying to obsess over every little thing just to get it into my head. Hence this tiny write-up!

I'm a minimalist, so trying to think through the absolute minimum hardware I need to add to this bike:

* KNOG bell
* headlamp
* tail-lamp
* lock

Not sure about:

* pannier rack and bag
* puncture kit

Other stuff:

* roof rack
* hooks for the storage cage

The Path 3 is a premium urban bike designed to take all the road can throw at it. Urban commuting is tough on bikes, and the Path 3 tackles obstacles such as gutters, steps, rocks and roots with ease.

A keen eye will note that the frame on this bike is slightly more comfortable than a road with its slightly more raised handlebars, its shorter wheelbase and slacker head tube angle. This more upright riding style allows you to see and avoid obstacles with ease.

For those wanting to do touring, or add a baby seat, it is reassuring to note that you can add a pannier rack with the rack mounts built into the frame.

The Polygon Path 3 features an upgraded Shimano Acera / Altus 27 Speed drivetrain. When compared to the competition the Path 3 features a 9 speed rear cassette rather than the older 8 speed. These are then combined with 3 chainrings at the front, ensuring you have a low enough gear for the steepest of hills as well as a high enough gear for you to keep up with fast-moving traffic.

When you need to stop, dependable, Shimano hydraulic disc brakes provide great stopping power and sensitive modulation, so you can keep focused on the road and not worry about how much pressure you need to maintain on the levers.

Helping with speed and comfort, a set of 700x40c wheels transforms the way the bike feels, giving you more comfort as these wheels roll smoothly over road imperfections and carry speed with ease. These wheels are virtually unyielding thanks to double wall alloy rims and grippy, all condition city specific tyres.

Even with the hydraulic brakes, the bike comes in almost half a kilo lighter than the Path 2, so if the budget can afford it, the bike represents excellent all-round value.

The Polygon Path 3 is a no-nonsense bike designed for the avid commuter who knows what city riding requires.
