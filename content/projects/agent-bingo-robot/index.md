A couple of years ago, Jules got given a cheap toy robot, and it wasn't long before it broke. He wasn't too fussed[^1] and eventually let me tear it to pieces. My big plan was to use the bot as a platform for experimentation, but of course you can see from the dates on the 'blog entries that it just didn't happen.

[^1]: Well, I don't remember him being too fussed anyway. Which probably means his tears and grief at losing this _precious toy_ (that he never played with) were brief.

## Plans

* find all the pieces
* test the DC motor drivers and an Arduino brain to return Bingo to "feature parity"
* Add ultrasonic distance sensors
* Add an LED display to his face or body
* ...
* robot uprising
