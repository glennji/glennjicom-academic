  It&#8217;s been a couple of weeks since our last post. Jules is back at school, giving Dee the space to ramp up her job search &#8212; with a twist, as she&#8217;s looking to move into agile project management (i.e. scrum master, product owner, etc.). Not something she&#8217;s (yet!) done, but seems like a good move (she&#8217;ll be good at it) and will be something she can enjoy &#8212; just as long as we can convince someone to take a chance! (She may invest in a scrum master course and certification, since recruiters at least will be looking for that.) Wish her luck!

  We start week 4 of <em>I Quit Sugar </em>today, with a smaller than usual cook-up: I made some faux rice (cauliflower and broccoli) while Dee has made some delicious pesto (above). Thai prawn curry tonight, but this afternoon we&#8217;re saying goodbye to our friends the (other) Masons &#8212; they&#8217;ve sold their Annandale house and are off for a good long (12 months?) caravaning holiday. I probably don&#8217;t need to tell you I&#8217;m jealous&#8230;

[<img class="aligncenter" title="{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Fresh pesto and homemade gozleme&quot;}" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7DWSSFm6ifs/WQVbHxNUbWI/AAAAAAABSJA/9-HO6sY1Swc9rfYhpl_vyutOOgHu5r3TACHM/s9999/20170430_130037-COLLAGE_5.jpg" width="1024" align="middle" />][1]

  As mentioned on Hangouts, we&#8217;re considering moving (e.g. to Concord) for considerably cheaper rent, a backyard (!!) and a slightly longer commute. It&#8217;s truly bizarre how much rent varies from suburb to suburb, but considering <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/01/23/sydney-has-the-second-most-unaffordable-housing-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sydney has the second most unaffordable housing in the world</a> it&#8217;s nice to know we can save some money &#8212; while still keeping Jules in the school he loves.

  I&#8217;m keeping myself busy, too:

  I&#8217;m training for the half-marathon in September (and have actually bought the entry!!). Gym and/or running most days and I&#8217;m finally seeing some muscle definition and fat minimisation (if not weight loss &#8212; scales may not lie, but I&#8217;m 100kg (+5kg) and skinnier than I&#8217;ve been in ages. Must be all muscle?). As a reminder, a half-marathon is about 21km, and I&#8217;m currently running about 4km without a break &#8230; so I&#8217;ve still got a way to go. (Hopefully more fat loss will help, too.)

  Work isn&#8217;t too busy, but I&#8217;ll be finishing up on the project in a couple of weeks AND I&#8217;m a &#8220;founder&#8221; of another business &#8212; a marketing friend had an idea (hush hush) and I&#8217;m coding up an Android app and backend for a demo which he can use to try to get seed capital. He&#8217;s in London at the moment, but may come back to Sydney so we can work on it together. (I&#8217;m also going to launch my <a href="http://www.distinguished.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distinguished: clothing and accessories</a> store tonight &#8212; it&#8217;s all about the hustle!)

  But clearly I STILL don&#8217;t have enough to do because I&#8217;ve also started writing a book on &#8220;full stack&#8221; engineering &#8212; a little philosophy, a little technology and pointers to everything from Javascript to NoSQL to machine learning and AI &#8230; oh, and to that end I&#8217;ve started a <em>Machine Learning</em> course this month (from Stanford, on Coursera). All in all, I can probably benefit from a slightly longer commute, just to get through my six-hours a week of course work!
