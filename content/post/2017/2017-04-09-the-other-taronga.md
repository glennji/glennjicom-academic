Sad-ish news: Dee&#8217;s contract is not being renewed. So she&#8217;s on the hunt for work!

Despite our new single-income status, we spent last weekend at the Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo, &#8220;glamping&#8221; in the Zoofari Park there. We explored the zoo on Day #1, before checking into our &#8220;tent&#8221;: a canvas structure, true, but we hot and cold water, electricity, a massive four-poster bed and a wooden deck from which we could watch the giraffes, addax and other animals.  We had a late night guided tour of the zoo &#8212; elephants, tigers, rhinos &#8212; followed by cocktails, chess and a meal in the &#8220;club&#8221; with the rest of the zoofaristas. A few too many drinks for me, considering the _really early _(6:50 am) tour the next day; thankfully Dee let me sleep in, and the organisers even had the bus swing by for me (at 8 am) before heading to the elephants!

A really great experience and, even better, it was all paid for in advance!

(It wasn&#8217;t just the cocktails that had me feeling a little shady in the morning, let&#8217;s be clear: I&#8217;ve also been fighting a cold all week, thanks to that one inconsiderate person who insists on making an appearance at work &#8212; spreading the germs &#8212; before fobbing off early. If anything, I like to believe the cocktail and wine helped, albeit not as much as the pseudoephedrine and codeine.)
  
This week we start another challenge: Sarah Wilson&#8217;s **I Quit Sugar** 8-week programme.

We&#8217;ve got a couple of her cookbooks, and really admire her ethos (fresh, homemade, reuse everything, waste nothing). A couple of dishes have been amazing (if not entirely ketogenic &#8212; but I&#8217;m yet to calculate the macros of the meals coming up) and today Dee did a massive cook-up for the rest of the week (another bit of Sarah Wilson&#8217;s advice, which has been working remarkably well for the last couple of weeks). We have _chilli verde_ for lunch tomorrow and curried sausages for dinner; from then, it&#8217;s leftovers each lunch-time and a new recipe for dinner &#8212; hopefully easy, since Dee&#8217;s done all the hard work already.
  
For week one we start weaning off fructose, artificial sweeteners and (sadly?) booze. I&#8217;ll go back to my keto-friendly ways (no bread, no milk, no rice, no potatoes &#8212; unless it&#8217;s mandated in the IQS programme &#8212; and butter and coconut oil in coffee) and back to the gym and jūjutsu, so I expect to see some real gains (or losses, depending on what you&#8217;re measuring). It will be hard to stop buying the delicious artificially-sweetened protein shakes after a gym session, but I can do it: I&#8217;ve already done 6 weeks of &#8220;clean&#8221; eating earlier, so this should be a doddle.
  
I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s more that&#8217;s happened since the last post, but even writing this much has been a challenge, as nobody knows interruptions like a 5-year old: &#8220;come see this! can I have a sandwich? I need a poo&#8221;. Oh, school holidays start this week! &#8220;Lucky&#8221; mummy will be home!
