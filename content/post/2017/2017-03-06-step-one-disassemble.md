This weekend I finally convinced Jules that we should take his robot apart. Admittedly, he might have been less enthusiastic if [Agent Bingo][1] didn&#8217;t already need surgery &#8212; one of the DC motors in her legs had stopped working, so the poor thing could only walk around in circles. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; I promised, &#8220;We can fix this.&#8221;
  
If only she knew that my idea of &#8220;fix&#8221; was a brain transplant&#8230;
  
With the shell open, and Jules starting to get bored, I sketched out what I thought was our best option:

  * resolder her leg motor (!!)
  * take everything out of her cybernetic skull: controller board, &#8220;eyes&#8221;, IR sensor.
  * leave her body mechanics alone (it&#8217;s a hard plastic gearbox surrounding a single DC motor, which makes her arms and head move)
  * replace her controller with an Arduino, her eyes with ultrasonic distance sensors, and maybe a display on her chest

So I&#8217;ve ordered the parts, but still haven&#8217;t resoldered the poor &#8216;bots leg &#8212; tonight I&#8217;ll do that, reassemble her in her &#8220;original&#8221; condition/capability-matrix, and let my son have his toy back. [icon name=&#8221;smile-o&#8221; class=&#8221;&#8221; unprefixed_class=&#8221;&#8221;]
  
For a little while.
