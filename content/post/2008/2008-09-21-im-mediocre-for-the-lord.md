I&#8217;m going to have one of the beers that have been in the bottom of our fridge for eternity &#8211; I&#8217;m pretty sure that at the beginning of the Universe, God said, &#8220;Let there be beer in the bottom of Glenn&#8217;s fridge.&#8221;  Then he said, &#8220;Oh, and let there be light, yeah, light&#8217;s good.&#8221;
  
It just went downhill from there.
  
Like last night: I was trying to avoid watching The X-Factor (a ridiculous talent show, if you don&#8217;t know, and if you don&#8217;t know then hello from the future!). At one point I dropped my guard and found myself watching a brother and sister act who wanted to use music to spread the word of God.
  
They were crap, in case you were on the edge of your seat wondering, crap and borderline-creepy (they sang &#8220;Time Of My Life&#8221; aka the Dirty Dancing song). My comment was, &#8220;Somewhere there&#8217;s a guy with a big beard and white robes shaking his head and asking why he always gets the losers, whilst nearby a red-faced, be-horned gent in a dapper three-piece is pissing himself laughing.&#8221;
  
Seriously, people, you think someone would let them get arrested, let alone nailed up to a bit of four-be-two, _for that_??  Iesus loves you, but everyone else thinks you&#8217;re a f*ckwit.
