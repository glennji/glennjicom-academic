Today we bought our aeroplane tickets back to Australia for December-January, after a weekend of research and planning (for both the cheapest tickets, and how we were actually best going to pay for &#8217;em).
  
In the end, we had a good deal from Austravel which Dee printed took into Flightcenter to see if they could beat. It was with Cathay Pacific, each leg was 11hrs and we had 6 hours in Hong Kong to see a few quick sites (e.g. giant Buddha statues).
  
When she got there, they couldn&#8217;t match it &#8212; the Austravel booking system was down. So Dee spoke to them on the phone and found out that the price we were quoted was for August only &#8230; and we&#8217;re one day into September! Bollocks!
  
Luckily, the Flightcenter people were nice and agreed to beat the &#8220;new&#8221; best Austravel price. They also looked around for some other options &#8230; and so we&#8217;re not going to Hong Kong anymore!
  
Instead, we&#8217;re flying Korean Air via Seoul. Again, 11 hour legs (not too bad providing we can sleep). Better yet, because the flights don&#8217;t connect on the way home, we&#8217;re getting put up in a 5-star hotel in Seoul! We get in at night, stay at the hotel, and have until probably lunchtime to check out some of Korea.
  
Fun!
