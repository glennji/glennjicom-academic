I was reading/learning last night about the two (often competing) congnitive systems we have; for lack of better terminology I&#8217;m going to call them the &#8220;dopamine system&#8221; (DS) and the &#8220;cognitive system&#8221; (CS).
  
Apparently the DS has developed to respond quickly to &#8220;instant&#8221; (or &#8220;instance&#8221;) decisions. Like when someone brings snacks in, and you happen to walk past thinking you could do with a snack. Studies show that if you offer someone a snack of fruit or chocolate, 70%+ will go for chocolate.
  
The CS on the other hand takes longer to make decisions, but is able to plan ahead.  (Actually, I think it takes responsibility for long-term decisions, but delegates quick-win stuff to the DS.  But that&#8217;s just my internal observations.)  So if you offer to bring a snack to someone next week, 70%+ go for the fruit.
  
CS prefers the healthy fruit option; DS likes the quick win of chocolate.  Same goes for addiction: the CS knows something might be bad in the long run, but the DS is designed to make the decision about _whether to have this thing right now_.  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a struggle &#8212; the DS and CS are trying to override each other.
  
My next steps are to determine strategies I can use to optimise my operational- or run-plan, utilising the CS and DS in the best way.
  
e.g. strategies to make me go to the gym:

  * (CS) wants to be fit, so make a generalised plan for when to go to the gym; not too detailed because the DS is a tricky b*stard.
  * (DS) wants immediate gratification, so when leaving work focus on getting a snack before the gym. Make sure to get the snack as quickly as possible.
  * (DS) When approaching the gym, start thinking of the enjoyable experiences of stretching, and the adrenaline-rush when cycling/rowing/running.

i.e. I need to short-circuit the DS from deciding it doesn&#8217;t want to go (at the last second) by focusing on how great it is.
