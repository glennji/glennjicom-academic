It has been a long week this week, largely due to Dee&#8217;s work schedule: she&#8217;s been on the early-shift, which has meant getting up some time between 5am (on Monday) and 6:30am (by Friday) i.e. a case of finding exactly _how late_ she can leave it to get to work by 7 o&#8217;clock in the morning.
  
I&#8217;ve _tried_ to get up at the same time, but I&#8217;m really not a morning-person. On the other hand, I&#8217;d happily stay up &#8217;til dawn watching anime and drinking sak√©, so maybe my &#8220;range of consciousness&#8221; is just time-shifted a couple of hours. In any case, even _not_ getting up at 5am has lead me to be tired at work, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to clocking off at 17:30 tonight.
  
S&#8217;posed to be good weather this weekend, so a barbeque will be in order at some point; the AFL grand-final is tomorrow afternoon (Australian time) so perhaps we can roll that in too. (Dee will say she doesn&#8217;t like watching the footy, but like every red-blooded Aussie girl she really does. I have to believe that.)
