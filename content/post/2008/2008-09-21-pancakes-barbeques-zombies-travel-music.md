After a &#8220;hearty&#8221; breakfast of pancakes and golden-syrup (f*ck you, maple-syrup), made by yours truly no less, we&#8217;re off to the shops for supplies: hot coals (well, cold coals to start with), unidentifiable meat (snags), potatoes, cabbage, carrot (obligatory salads). Anything I&#8217;ve forgotten? Oh yeah, as much beer as I can carry.
  
Actually, that&#8217;s not accurate &#8211; I want as much beer as I can drink in an afternoon, and not a drop more! We don&#8217;t have the storage space in the &#8216;fridge. Of course, we may have some help disposing of said beer so perhaps it will all work out.
  
It&#8217;s not a celebration so much as a way to feed the poor starving med-student Lawrence, Colleen&#8217;s little brother (although we&#8217;re not going to ask him to bring anything for the barbeque, for obvious reasons. Aren&#8217;t all doctors flesh-eating zombies/cannibals who love performing surgery because it&#8217;s a cheap way to fill up their storage freezers? Or am I being unfair and it&#8217;s only NHS doctors?)
  
But I think we&#8217;ll use it as a celebration regardless: we made it through the week (week two of Dee&#8217;s work, for one thing), and we&#8217;ve got a sketchy plan about what we&#8217;re doing (and where we&#8217;re going) in Australia this December.
  
It&#8217;s been a long time since we were home &#8211; over three years. In that time, my sister has manufactured two new nieces; my brother and his wifey are a good way through their own production schedule of a child-unit I will forever call Little Terror 1.0 (he can play with our child-to-be, Pugsley. Or Pong. Or Chris&#8217;s child, Boots. No, we&#8217;re not all preggers &#8211; it was just what we decided one Sunday afternoon &#8230; and with that, a seamless segway back to whatever the hell it was I was talking about!)
  
I miss my friends, my family. I miss decent fish and chips. I miss small-town country yokels who think I&#8217;m &#8220;gay&#8221; because I wore a shirt to the pub, and was surrounded by women (who must&#8217;ve thought I was A Big City Lawyer Or Som&#8217;in). Wait, I don&#8217;t miss that bit at all &#8211; f*ck you, Maryborough! (grin) But yeah, I don&#8217;t normally get homesick (I&#8217;m an emotionless autonomic robot after all), so last night I dug out all the old Aussie albums and simulated homesickness: The Whitlams, the Secret Life Of Us soundtracks, Triple-J Hottest 100, Powderfinger, The Sharp, Something For Kate &#8230;
  
I couldn&#8217;t find any Horsehead &#8216;though. May have to rip Warrick&#8217;s CD when I get there.
  
Our trip will be a whirlwind: London to South Korea to Melbourne, then to Bendigo, Adelaide, Darwin and Brisbane. Somewhere in between all the travels we might even see some of those friends and family I miss so much &#8211; you never know! Grant and Sheila&#8217;s wedding, Greg&#8217;s bamitzvah, the birth of Little Terror 1.0 (well, maybe).
  
Going to need a holiday after this holiday. Shame I won&#8217;t have any annual leave left. Perhaps I can work from a beach in Spain? I&#8217;ll ask on Monday and let you know.
