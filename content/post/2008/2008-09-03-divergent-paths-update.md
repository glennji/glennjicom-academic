A while ago I [wrote about][1] a female friend who was considering becoming Muslim, and I expressed a concern over both the underlying motivations for such a decision, and the possible outcome.
  
Some time later, the &#8220;second option&#8221; has come to pass &#8212; she has rejected her Islamic man and turned away from the religion. Whilst I don&#8217;t want to make judgement calls &#8211; well, okay, I _love_ making judgement calls, but in this instance I&#8217;m trying to stay objective &#8211; she certainly seems a lot _happier_ and _healthier_ (mentally) since making the decision.
  
Which is not to say Islam is bad for a person, blah blah blah<small><sup>1</sup></small>. But clearly her infatuation was unhealthy, and if she had become Muslim it would have been for all the wrong reasons.

> 1. Actually, I do tend to think that religion is &#8220;bad&#8221; for a lot of people (including those on the sharp end of both types of religious persecution: persecution _for_ and persecution _by_. And don&#8217;t tell me it doesn&#8217;t happen.), but I am open to the idea that it&#8217;s not bad for _everybody_. Nothing is universal, after all. And since &#8220;religion&#8221; means different things to different people, it would mean slapping the &#8220;bad&#8221;-label on such a multitude of ideas and practises that it would be both gross stereotyping and ignorance of the highest order. Can you have high degrees of ignorance?
