I have a piano! It is <span style="font-style: italic;">teh awesome.</span>
  
Dee got it from an online place for my birthday. It&#8221;s a Korg SP-250 (stage piano), digital, full size and with that fancy-pant hammer-action that makes it feel like a &#8220;real&#8221; (analogue?) piano. So. Very. Cool. It arrived yesterday, and it was all I could do not to fob off work and come home for it!
  
Last weekend we visited London&#8221;s &#8220;Tin Pan Alley&#8221;, the music-strip in the West End. We found the piano there, but for about an extra £100 &#8212; no thanks! So for £50 cheaper we got the piano and a stool from DV247. Not bad at all, especially since we had to wait less than a week for it to arrive!
  
Funny: the evening after visiting Tin Pan Alley we went to a Jazz night at the 100 Club on Oxford Street &#8230; and the pianist had the same piano! Very cool &#8212; before Saturday I&#8221;d only seen it in pictures, then over the course of a day I got to play with one (in the store) and listen to someone hammering out frenetic melodies and slammin&#8221; chords, as we danced and jived (unlicensed, of course) in any free floor-space.
  
The weekend before that, you may know, we spent in the Cotswolds &#8212; picturesque English countryside, tawny rough-hewn stone for walls, houses, people (okay, the people weren&#8221;t made of stone, but wouldn&#8221;t that be cool!). We stayed in Bourton On The Water; Dee tricked me because I thought we were going to drink <span style="font-weight: bold;">bourbon on the water</span>! Still, getting away for a relaxing weekend was probably better. Probably.
  
The town itself is billed as &#8220;the Venice of England&#8221;, but the locals didn&#8221;t take too kindly to me tying a bunch of ducks together in the shape of a gondala and paddling along the little waterway that twisted through the township. The ducks didn&#8221;t mind, and gave me lots of little friendship-bites to show how much they respected and admired me.
  
The countdown is well and truly on now &#8212; we both can&#8221;t wait to get home and see everyone, and eat decent fish and chips, and feel sunlight, and drink cold beer.
