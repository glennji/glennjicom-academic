> [glennji][1]{.tweet}: I still hate the Met: Northern Line canned at 8:50am this morning; took me another 40min on the bus to get here. It&#8217;s 45min walk from home!

Yep, I&#8217;m blogging tweets now. So I slept in this morning; Danielle got up at 6am, and whilst I could&#8217;ve followed her I found it far easier to roll over and bury my head in my pillow. Easier at the time, but I suspect the Universe was trying to tell me something.
  
So I got up at 7:30, which is plenty of time really. However, I thought I&#8217;d take the train because I was running perhaps 10mins late &#8211; I put it down to an extra 10 minutes trying to find all my rarely-used gym gear and pack it. I walked up to King&#8217;s Cross and crammed onto the third south-bound Northern Line train; the first two trains were too full to do more than shuffle closer to the doors.
  
So, finally crammed in, sweating like anything but a pig (they don&#8217;t sweat you know), counting the stations left &#8217;til Bank/Monument. And at 10 to 9, Old Street, plenty of time left to get to work, the bad news &#8211; signal failure (which I&#8217;m sure is a euphemism for, I don&#8217;t know, &#8220;Charlie in Control is drunk again&#8221;. Or something).
  
We sat for 5 minutes, waiting, hoping. The driver announced that we were stationary &#8220;until further notice&#8221; but still we held on. Then the station-manager announced that they were hoping to &#8220;turn some south-bound trains into north-bound trains&#8221; and the ensuing despair caused a mass exodus. I was lucky enough to be one of the first out the door, and raced ahead of the human tide through the ticket/flood-gates and out onto the street.
  
Now, those of you who know me know I don&#8217;t have a good sense of direction, and so I was feeling a bit scared that I would walk off in completely the wrong direction. Then, unable to find either a) a taxi or b) an ATM so I could pay for a taxi, I would eventually end up in Slough. Or Hogwarts. Luckily for me, the exits were signposted, and I could have a reasonably good chance that &#8220;City Road South&#8221; probably headed south through the city. I walked to the nearest bus stop and hopped on the next appropriate bus.
  
The whole trip took over an hour; It&#8217;s only a 40 minute _walk_.
