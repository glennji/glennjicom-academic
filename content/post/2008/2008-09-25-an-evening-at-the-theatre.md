Indulged our thespian hearts with a trip to Shakespeare&#8221;s New Globe Theatre last night.
  
First: dinner at Harry&#8221;s Bar in the city. Named after a famous cocktail (coquetier! eggcup!) bar in Venezia, Italia (Venice, Italy ;-)), Harry&#8221;s of London shares, well, _nothing_ with it&#8221;s Italian namesake: it&#8221;s a wine bar and restaurant, and the wine is Chilean, Australian and French rather than Italian. Nevertheless, the food was good: I had gnocchi (maybe Italiano!) with prawns; Dee tried the risotto (ooh, maybe it&#8221;s more Italian than I gave it credit for). We ate with a friend of Dee&#8221;s, her partner and two of her friends, and although we were both tired and didn&#8221;t really like the idea of meeting new people just then, the night turned out okay.
  
Apparently Harry&#8221;s in Venezia is really expensive; in London the bill was cut down to a more manageable size by a mid-week special: half price on the total bill if you have 2 courses. It was cheaper to have a main and dessert than to just have a main! Now that&#8221;s a savings plan I could get into. Guess there is some good in the credit-crunch &#8212; with all the bankers out of work, swanky places like Harry&#8221;s has to let rabble like me in!

][1] After dinner we wandered down towards the Thames and across one of the many bridges, the city beginning to sparkle as dusk mellowed to dark. Behind us, Wren&#8221;s St. Paul&#8221;s loomed ominously, whilst ahead the whitewashed walls and thatched roof of The Globe warmly invited us; it could&#8221;ve been the late 1600&#8221;s, with both Globe and the great church rebuilt after the Great Fire of London. Or so I imagined.
  
We handed over our little cardboard tokens and shuffled up the wooden stairs to the top gallery, whereby we were afforded a near-birds-eye view down upon the stage the the players. We sat upon hard wooden benches, eschewing the hired cushions that those of less-hardy temperament (and posterior fortitude) felt necessary. Shortly the strains of a light tune played on lutes and horns signalled for quiet; a hush fell upon the crowd.
  
_The play&#8221;s the thing_, you see, and the thing in this case was a jolly little tale, &#8220;The Merry Wives Of Windsor&#8221;. A comedy, although I could not say whether t&#8221;were the skill of the Bard or that of the players that made it so; t&#8221;was a genuine laugh-out-loud, raucous comedy. Ooh, look thee upon these words! T&#8221;is like the particular, peculiar method of Shakespeare&#8221;s own art hath soaked my brain; stewing in olde English forms of yore, it cannot help but express itself as I pen this journal!

So: perched upon hard benches (of birch or cedar) we watched a tale of clever wives, jealous husbands, bellicose doctors and rotund knights and laughed. Sooth: I could not decide whether Shakespeare so influenced English humour, or whether the comedic endeavours of Fawlty Towers and it&#8221;s ilk were the influence for the players of this tale; in either case, you&#8221;ve not seen impotent fury until you&#8221;ve seen a skinny English gent in a badly-fitted wig first tempting a knight to make advances upon his wife, then cursing that she, in appearances at least, entertains such carnal ideas with said knight.
  
&#8220;CUCKOLD!!&#8221;
