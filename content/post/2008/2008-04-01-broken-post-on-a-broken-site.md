I still don&#8217;t have an Internet connection at home, so of course this website has sat un-used and without an update for a long time. Today it&#8217;s a slow day at work, so I thought I&#8217;d quickly write an update or two. Oh, and change the theme, at least until I can fix the original one.
  
Dee&#8217;s mum has arrived, and she traveled for 2 weeks around Europe with Dee &#8212; so jealous that I didn&#8217;t go, but it would&#8217;ve both changed the dynamic and made it a lot more expensive. They&#8217;re planning a trip to Scotland this week, then some weekend trips away (which I&#8217;ll be able to go on too). I got two presents from the European vacation: an espresso cup set (perfect for the coffee machine Dee bought me in December) and a &#8220;cut throat&#8221; razor (which I&#8217;ve wanted for a while &#8211; scary, but cool, and now I&#8217;m shaving my head and face I really should learn how to handle a razor).
  
Settling in with the housemates too, although it&#8217;s been a bit weird with Colleen of late &#8212; she&#8217;s finding religion but I worry about what it might do to her. I really like having Chris around, &#8216;though &#8212; he&#8217;s a good influence even when he&#8217;s trying not to be.
  
I hope we get the Internet back tomorrow. I miss it so.
