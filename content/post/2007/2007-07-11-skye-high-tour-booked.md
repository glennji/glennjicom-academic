With Chris Kendrick coming to visit, I went ahead and booked a [Haggis Tour: Skye High][1].
  
This should see us travelling around Scotland and Skye on a bus for a few days, with plenty of opportunities for walking (Chris&#8217;s idea) and drinking whiskey (my idea), as well as a chance to meet some new people on the bus itself. We&#8217;ll stay in backpacker hostels, nice and cheap for the poor Aussie lad, and should get to see some awesome sights &#8211; Skye, Loch Ness, Inverness, Culloden Moor, castles, monsters, Celtic battles ahoy!
  
Lucky I just bought a 1GB photo card. I cannae wait!
