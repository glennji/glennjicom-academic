Well it&#8217;s nearly the weekend and none of my gear &#8212; the RAM replacement, a new HDD to piggyback the NAS, a copy of (ergh!) Vista &#8212; has arrived from Ebuyer. So, for this weekend at least, I&#8217;m stuck with the laptop. That&#8217;s a 1.3GHz Celeron laptop with 256MB of RAM and a dodgy keypad; it&#8217;s not the most powerful beast, but hopefully all I&#8217;m doing this weekend is web-based. Once I get the new PC installed I&#8217;ll probably blow away Ubuntu (on the laptop) and try the low-resource Xubuntu &#8230; or roll-my-own, depending on how much time I have to waste.
  
I haven&#8217;t heard back from the mob in London, so perhaps they really _were_ scared that I couldn&#8217;t remember basic JDBC-related classes &#8212; if you&#8217;re reading this (a slim chance indeed) then know that I&#8217;ve done lots of JDBC before, but not for a couple of years (it&#8217;s all CM EJBs these days) and my mind simply went blank! I&#8217;m going to blame that on the fact that this was my first interview in a long time, I was at a noisy caf√© on my lunchbreak, and frankly I was feeling unneccessarily nervous!
  
Oh well, whatever is meant to be will be.
  
What does that have to do with the &#8220;bits&#8221; for my PC? Well I wanted to do some coding &#8212; specifically playing the the Google Web Toolkit and the GData APIs &#8212; but there&#8217;s no way I can run Java 6 and Eclipse on a low-spec&#8217;d Celeron &#8230; not that I&#8217;m not going to try, but the last time I had it all going it was just so painful I had to uninstall. And that was running console-based apps (data mining log files, creating some &#8220;grep like&#8221; command-line tools for work).
