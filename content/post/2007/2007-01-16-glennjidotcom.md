I relaunched [glennji.com][1] last night, which with Drupal was as easy as changing a setting from &#8220;offline&#8221; to &#8220;online&#8221;. Today I&#8217;ve tweaked the theme (with the theme_editor module, since I don&#8217;t have FTP access from work) to rectify a couple of XHTML validation errors and warnings &#8212; and I wouldn&#8217;t have noticed them but for the HTML Validator extension in Firefox. There&#8217;s still a few funny things about the theme and stylesheet, but I think they&#8217;re mostly only in the admin area and thus not visible from the outside. Once I iron it all out I&#8217;ll donate the theme to [drupal.org][2] I think.
  
In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, I&#8217;ve also launched a new site: [glennji.org][3]! This is my purely personal, ego-driven site for rants and rambles, ridiculous ideas and any scribbles I happen to get around to scanning. Unlikely to be interesting to anybody who doesn&#8217;t know me, I&#8217;m guessing.
  
It&#8217;s another Drupal site, running a separate instance in an &#8220;add-on&#8221; domain on the same webserver, mostly because I couldn&#8217;t figure out who to host multiple websites on the same space any other way (i.e. it probably involves updating DNS records, for one thing, and I don&#8217;t have shell access to the webserver to configure Apache for another).
  
Of course, writing some decent content/applications/themes to host is by far the more difficult task. It&#8217;s also more fun!
