It&#8217;s new, and orange. Glennji.org is the personal site of Glenn J. Mason, where he rants and rambles and slips in and out of third person. At the moment, it&#8217;s pretty empty, but I plan to upload my squiggles and cartoons, any random ideas I have for stuff, and just basically vent about work and life. It is the personal news, rather than boring techy stuff that my dear, dear, insane-kitty friend Sheila Sheppard (tee hee!) complained so heartily about.
