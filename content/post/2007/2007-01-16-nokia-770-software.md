I bought a Nokia 770 web-tablet a few months back, and absolutely love it &#8212; it&#8217;s newspaper, TV-guide, SSH client, instant messenger, VOIP handset, daily planner and notepad. I tend to take it everywhere, but it is probably most useful in the lounge room in that it removes the need for a precariously knee-perched laptop and the mass of cables that goes with it.
  
I&#8217;ve got a few themes, but I&#8217;ve not yet found one that is based on the lovely Gnome Desktop. There&#8221;s a nice little Java application that can quickly build Nokia 770 themes, so I&#8221;ve got no excuse really.
  
There&#8221;s also a bunch of software (including games) that I&#8217;d like for the Nokia, and it doesn&#8217;t look like anyone else is going to do it for me! I&#8217;ve tried installing the devkit a little while ago, but it&#8221;s all changed now so I&#8217;ll have to start again.
  
I&#8221;m also gradually learning Python, since that&#8221;s quite a powerful platform on the Nokia (and Gnome in general).
