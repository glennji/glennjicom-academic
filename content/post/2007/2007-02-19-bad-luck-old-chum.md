After a bit of bad luck, it turns out that I didn&#8217;t actually get the Canonical job &#8211; what a pity! I&#8217;ve also had a few days off work, so not done any Python coding, but I am playing with Subversion and installing all I need to try some development for the Nokia 770 so it&#8217;s not all bad.
