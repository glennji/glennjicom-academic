I&#8217;m at work early this morning, sitting around waiting for other people to do stuff (I&#8217;ve done everything I need to already!) so we can get somebody to sign off the whole morning as a success. Oh the joy of tech!
  
I&#8217;m pretty much convinced that we won&#8217;t be going to Singapore now. It just seems to me that Dee&#8217;s work is stalling, trying to get a little &#8220;natural churn&#8221; and have people quit (rather than having to find them new work or give them redundancy payouts). Her team-leader (accidently?) mentioned that &#8220;&#8230; things will change in six weeks, obviously.&#8221; Six weeks? What happens in six weeks, asked Dee. &#8220;Oh, nothing, that was just a number I pulled out of the air.&#8221; Yeah, I believe that, really. No, I do. What do you mean, sarcasm? I don&#8217;t even know what _sarcasm means!_
  
That&#8217;s okay, London is nice this time of year. I&#8217;m in the &#8220;resource pool&#8221; now, so I could get assigned to a project down there at any time. I hope it&#8217;s soon.
