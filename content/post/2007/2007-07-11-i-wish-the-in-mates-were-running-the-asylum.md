Boy do I _ever_ not want to go to work today.
  
I&#8217;ve been up for a while &#8212; around 6:30 &#8212; and it&#8217;s now after 9am, so it&#8217;s not like I couldn&#8217;t get in early and catch up on some of the always-present, always-urgent, never-scheduled, always-stupid tasks that seem to get punted down upon us (from manager to manager all the way down to the lowly &#8220;plebs&#8221;, the betas, the only ones who actually seem to _do_ anything &#8212; us, in other words). Take yesterday, for example: as well as the what-the? comment from my manager, I spent the good part of the afternoon needlessly pasting names and details of all our user accounts into a spreadsheet &#8230; even though the names all exist in a shiny little &#8220;single-sign on&#8221; database application. Oh, and the fact that we&#8217;ve got well over 70,000 users &#8212; more than will fit in a single Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. It&#8217;s stupid whichever way you cut it. And that&#8217;s _before_ even considering the security implications of having a list of user details on a network share somewhere.
  
Today I have to write my &#8220;Personal Development Plan&#8221;, despite the fact that it seems that our department has been set up as a kind of fly-trap &#8212; once you&#8217;re in, you&#8217;re not going anywhere. So, hmm, this year I want to develop my sitting-around-waiting-for-stuff-to-break skills, along with my answering-stupid-questions-from-stupid-people abilities. Yay team!
