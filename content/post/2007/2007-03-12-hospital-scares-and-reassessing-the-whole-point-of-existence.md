Danielle&#8217;s probably told enough people by now that I can put it up here and let rest of our dear friends know &#8212; the &#8220;hospital trip&#8221; I alluded to in the last post was because Dee suffered a seizure at work one morning. These can have a lot of different reasons and triggers, we found out &#8212; stress (she is), pregnancy (we&#8217;re not), diet, alcohol, blood-sugar, epilepsy &#8212; but spending much of the morning in hospital discounted some and gave more focus to others. It&#8217;s unlikely to be epilepsy, for example, since there was no real &#8220;trigger&#8221; and she wasn&#8217;t anywhere she wouldn&#8217;t normally be on a weekday. Scary, but all is good.
  
We went to see the neurologist on Friday, who first asked a lot of questions and performed some &#8220;physical challenge&#8221; questions &#8212; close your eyes, squeeze a fist, touch your nose &#8212; before referring us to the cardiology department for an ECG (electrocardiogram!). He reassured us that, of all the people who suffer a seizure (or was that just non-epileptic seizure? I should have asked for his sources!) some 60% don&#8217;t ever suffer a second one.
  
It&#8217;s been a month since Danielle has hers, and there has been no sign of another (thankfully!). We&#8217;re hoping she&#8217;s in that (slight) majority in this case; we have another appointment in a few months for a repeat checkup and possibly the other tests we thought she would get &#8212; the EEG (electroenchephalogram) and CT-scan (computed tomography, which means the image is created from a series of 2-dimensional sections). On the other hand, as each month passes the likelihood of another seizure drops right off, so perhaps they won&#8217;t even do those tests.
  
I&#8217;d be happy for them not to. I think it&#8217;s really been a wake-up call for the both of us &#8212; we should spend every moment we can enjoying life together, because you just never know &#8230; The train trip into Glasgow for me that morning was one of the longest I&#8217;ve ever been on, and not just because I got the wrong train (although looking back, that was definitely a factor &#8212; never go to Glasgow Central, always go to Glasgow Queen street!). We both been re-evaluating what we want out of life at the moment, and how best to find (or create!) our own &#8220;happy place&#8221;. The result, hopefully, will be a healthier, happier and more full life!
  
To that end, we&#8217;re investigating relocating down to London to be closer to the major airport &#8212; we have so many places yet unexplored, and travel from Edinburgh or Glasgow is ridiculously more expensive (most flights take a hop down to Heathrow first at any rate). It might be nice to catch up with Hippy and Mal from time to time too &#8212; it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;ve made many ties to people up here (Gregor if you&#8217;re reading, two things: you are always welcome to visit us, and who gave you a computer??).
  
One good thing about living and working in Edinburgh is that it&#8217;s inured us against the high rental prices &#8212; our current two bedroom flat is lovely (waterfront property after all, old chum) but expensive &#8212; so we don&#8217;t feel too bad looking at the cost of living in a two bedroom flat in London. In fact, we won&#8217;t even have to live out in the middle of nowhere like Grant and Sheila (hi guys!)!
  
It will be a balancing act, of course &#8212; rent vs. travel vs. time vs. work. But zone 2 shouldn&#8217;t be too far out, and there are some suburbs a few stops away from the financial district that have decent prices for decent apartments, so it&#8217;s looking more and more likely. Dee will start contracting &#8212; as a British citizen she can start a company and work through that rather than an existing &#8220;umbrella company&#8221; &#8212; and I will either transfer directly with the bank, or find another job. (In fact, the second option is rather appealing at the moment, as my supposed move to a technology department has been stalled for almost six months now.)
