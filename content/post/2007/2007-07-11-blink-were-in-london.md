(Did you think from the title that we&#8217;d finally &#8212; and suddenly! &#8212; made the next big move? Not yet, I&#8217;m afraid.)
  
Dee&#8217;s off to London this weekend for work, and I&#8217;m tagging along with her! She leaves tomorrow from Glasgow, whilst I&#8217;ll be on late-night flight from Edinburgh after work, and we&#8217;ll meet up somewhere near her work-provided hotel. She may also be working on Saturday and Sunday, so I could be out in the city on my own &#8212; perhaps I can meet up with some of my friends who seem to be congregating there at the moment?
  
Should be fun! She&#8217;ll be there until Tuesday, I think, but I&#8217;m back on Sunday night (working on Monday, worst luck).
  
And then we&#8217;re back again over Easter!
