So it&#8217;s a new year, apparently, and like nearly everyone in the &#8220;western world&#8221; I&#8217;ve succumbed to the temptation to evaluate my life, who I am and what I&#8217;m doing here, and as usual it&#8217;s mostly with a view towards doing things a little better this time around our favourite star. This perhaps could not be described as &#8220;noble&#8221;, exactly, but it surely does more good than harm. Unless, of course, you kick yourself (metaphorically speaking) when you almost-inevitably fail to live up to your own elevated expectations.
  
Which is why I like to spend the first weekend of the new year at home, drinking, smoking, watching TV and generally breaking every &#8220;resolution&#8221; I may have accidently made over Hogmanay. Once you&#8217;ve failed, the fear of failure is gone and you can get on with it; it&#8217;s your basic Bruce Lee &#8220;learn to be defeated&#8221; thing.
  
I did resist making &#8220;resolutions&#8221; &#8212; written down, carved in psychological stone &#8212; as much as I could, and I came through with some rather more general ideas about stuff I might want to try on, try out, take for a spin. It suits me that way, I think.
  
So I&#8217;m being healthier than I have been for a while, watching my calories and going to the gym. I&#8217;ve lost a couple of kilos excess baggage, which is nice, and I&#8217;m saving money by not buying my lunch everyday so it&#8217;s really win-win.
  
I&#8217;m also finally starting to listen to music again, thanks in no small part to my musically-focused Christmas presents: a pair of wireless Sennheiser headphones and a DAB radio. It feels like it&#8217;s been ages since I really listened to music, and I&#8217;d forgotten just how much I love it &#8212; I kick back with my &#8220;cans&#8221; on, streaming whatever I&#8217;ve downloaded from the web with [Songbird][1], and _just feel good_. It&#8217;s especially good when it means I sit down with a book rather than the TV.
  
Thanks to the DAB, I&#8217;m also waking up to &#8220;modern&#8221; music; I hope it will eventually soak in and I&#8217;ll actually recognise tracks, although it&#8217;s a pretty diverse bunch of stuff I&#8217;m getting from Songbird so who knows? Finally, Deeji has got herself a fancy-pants new phone, so I&#8217;ve got unlimited use of her iPod nano &#8230; and the rockin&#8217; in-ear headphones I found for her(Sennheiser, again &#8212; I really like their equipment!). Still need to copy all the &#8220;girly&#8221; music off and fill it with &#8220;my&#8221; stuff: indie rock and pop, electronica, some slow-ish angst-metal and anything obscure.
  
Of course, my own little MP3 player is a lanyard-bound Joybee, but I&#8217;ve now found that (once loaded up with heart-racing beats) it is absolutely perfect for the gym! It even looks a little like a digital stopwatch or something; you have to pretty fit and healthy to strap an iPod to your arm without looking a least a little like a complete _tool_, I think.
  
At the moment, I like **Merit, by _Cougar_**.
