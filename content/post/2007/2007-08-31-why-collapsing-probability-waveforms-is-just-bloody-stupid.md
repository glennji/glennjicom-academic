We live in a reality that is always under a probabilistic quantum flux, apparently. An electron travelling from A to B actually takes every possible path; the path we observe is an integral across the probability of each of these paths, &#8220;collapsing&#8221; into the most likely one at the point of observation.
  
What&#8217;s true of the very small (or very fast) is true of the very large, and everything in between. We observe the universe as it is now; this &#8220;collapses&#8221; the probability waves of every possible past into the most likely one; ergo, by existing, we created (selected) our own beginning.
  
Except it&#8217;s stupid. What makes us so special that we can &#8220;collapse&#8221; quantum reality into actual, observed reality? Are we each working on our own &#8220;copy&#8221; of reality? Am I the god of my realm?
  
Maybe, but again it&#8217;s beside the point. Rather than collapsing anything, consider this: if there is a fifth dimension containing all possible realities, then collapsing probability waveforms is exactly like <span style="font-style: italic;">moving</span> in the fifth dimension. So when we observe an electron, or a universe, we are moving to the point in the fifth dimension where that reality is expressed.
  
And because it&#8217;s a movement, we can&#8217;t just go from one state of reality to another without moving through the intermediate states. And moving through any dimension isn&#8217;t instantaneous, so there are a limited number of points we can go to, and one will be more likely than the others. (Actually, with the addition of a single &#8220;possible reality&#8221; dimension, there should really be two which are equally likely. Do we see this in quantum mechanics?)
  
Okay, so it&#8217;s actually the same thing as collapsing probability waves, but the representation sounds more sensible to me.
  
I think I should read up on quantum mechanics a bit.
