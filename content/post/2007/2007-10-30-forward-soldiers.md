The week begins.
  
For me it began with a cup of green tea, rather than a coffee, and I&#8217;m feeling somewhat weird so I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s because of that or just whatever was giving me a headache this morning (which is still around a little bit, despite taking nurofen). I think it&#8217;s probably the headache thing. Perhaps the small glass of Russian vodka last night was too much for me? Yeah, I doubt it too. Anyway, I don&#8217;t know if I feel weird enough that I should go home and lie down â€¦ or if I am just wanting to go home, and therefore building up the weirdness in my estimation of it. Does that make sense?
