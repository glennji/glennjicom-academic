I spoke to a company in London today; a kind of &#8220;first take&#8221; on the whole job-hunting thing, for me and the company both I think. They asked some just-barely technical questions, and whilst I answered most with ease, I was feeling nervous and my mind went blank for others (specifically on JDBC, but if you care about that you should probably be reading [the other site][1] instead). At the very least I can call it practice &#8212; the person I spoke to was non-technical, so I couldn&#8217;t ask about the things that are really important to me: open source, GNU/Linux, vi vs. emacs, Gnome vs. KDE. The usual stuff you ask in interviews.
  
If they aren&#8217;t too scared off by my complete incompetence at answering straightforward questions then perhaps I&#8217;ll get a call by Friday.
  
I&#8217;ve also asked my manager to speak to her Greater Evils about getting a transfer to London within the bank. Since I&#8217;m slated to move departments and they&#8217;ve already hired my replacement, you wouldn&#8217;t think it would be much of a stretch. Of course, I want to keep looking because who knows? Maybe the salary somewhere else will be just that much better!
  
Tonight we played Uno, I&#8217;ve tried a beer called &#8220;Single Malt&#8221; (it&#8217;s made with the same malt as is usually used for whiskey) and I&#8217;m scanning some of our hundreds and hundreds of photos into the computer. The photos are strictly Dee&#8217;s project; I&#8217;m ostensibly scanning them in just to play with the Linux drivers (Xsane and HPLIP for printing and scanning). It works great! It is a HP Photosmart C4180 all-in-one jobby: printer, scanner, copier. It worked instantly under Ubuntu (Windows of course needs drivers for everything &#8212; oh, poor Windows!) and the software (HPLIP) is good, showing how much color is left and providing various other tweaks.
  
It is now getting quite late but I&#8217;m unable to sleep for some reason. I may be breaking out the headphones and putting on something relaxing soon I think &#8212; perhaps some binaural beats?
