&#8230; and none too soon.  I was going a little crazy from wwwithdrawal, I think &#8212; our access from work is limited (to say the least), and I must have at least 12,000 unread emails in Gmail by now.  Not to mention the fact that I have to redesign my websites every month (it&#8217;s a sickness) and protect the web from wiki spam wherever possible.  So it&#8217;s a good thing for me, personally.
  
It&#8217;s also a good thing for Dee &#8212; she can start looking for work properly, rather than traipsing down to a grubby Internet café and forking over our hard-earned dosh for a slower-than-slow, crampy-chair, smelly-humans, crappy-coffee web experience.  We&#8217;ve got a desk and everything now, so it should be quite a good set up for her.  With the IT market booming, it shouldn&#8217;t be long until she lands a sweet contract in the middle of a trading floor.
  
We&#8217;ve been anything but idle whilst awaiting our Internetwork: we saw a West-End show (&#8220;Wicked&#8221;) with Dayna and her friends; we had tapas and sangria one night with one of Dee&#8217;s friends (a couple&#8217;s date, how droll!); we&#8217;ve eaten out more times than we should have (but the selection is great!); and we&#8217;ve blessed our flat with a balcony barbeque!  It&#8217;s all fun and games, but we&#8217;re settling into a more frugal existence now to save our pennies (and hopefully get into some good habits before Dee gets her job).
  
It actually works out better &#8212; in trying to be cheap, we&#8217;ve had to buy our ingredients fresh and make stuff from scratch!  Similarly, we&#8217;ve bought stuff to grow our own herbs and edibles!  Both are things we always talk about doing, so it&#8217;s funny that it took switching to a single income to make us actually try it.
