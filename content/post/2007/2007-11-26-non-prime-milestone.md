As the end of the year draws close so too does a number of &#8220;traditional&#8221; milestones &#8211; namely Christmas and more importantly Dee&#8217;s 30th birthday.
  
30 has always been one of the big ones &#8212; the first birthday when you start counting in decades rather than years, something to be dreaded, especially for women. A big one; the last one similar was 9 years previous, then 3 years before that, then 2. Not prime-number intervals, which are my favourites, but I do see the symbolism and desire for a big celebration.
  
I hope she likes her gifts. I hope she reads this before her birthday, too &#8212; it will drive her mad.
  
And Christmas, supposedly a birthday celebration too but more likely modelled on an existing &#8220;pagan&#8221; celebration; hijacked to make the religion easier to introduce. We went to Bath last weekend and heard about how the Romans found the natural spring worshipped as blessed by Sulis, a Celtic Goddess of healing. Healing? they said, That sounds like Minerva! And so the Goddess &#8220;Sulis Minerva&#8221; was named.
  
So what are you doing to celebrate the new year?
