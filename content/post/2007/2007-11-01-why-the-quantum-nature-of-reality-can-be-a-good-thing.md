So quantum reality is one of probabilities; right now, for me, the probability that I can spontaneously develop the ability to fly is quite low. At the moment, I&#8217;m occupying several dimensions &#8211; including the one (or more) which define all the possible realities, alongside the &#8220;normal&#8221; three in space and one in time. So I can&#8217;t fly because in this reality people don&#8217;t fly.
  
However, I can move through space and time (although I seem to be hurtling out of control through time, oh well). Maybe I can move through the &#8220;possible&#8221; dimension(s) too? Because they are just another &#8220;direction&#8221;, like spacetime, and I&#8217;m occupying some &#8220;space&#8221; in that dimension, I should be able to move around. And moving around in the &#8220;possible&#8221; dimension means altering my reality.
  
How do we move around in the 5th+ dimensions? Well, how do we move in the three regular ones? Our mind sends signals (via the brain, if you think there is a separation of brain and mind) to our limbs; our limbs convey us in the chosen direction. But there&#8217;s a difference between <span style="font-style: italic;">willing</span> your arm to move, and actually moving it. Try it &#8211; think &#8220;wiggle your finger&#8221; for a while, then just do it. What was the difference? The thoughts were the same, but there is definitely a different kind of <span style="font-style: italic;">flavour</span> to it.
  
Call it &#8220;command mode&#8221;, or intention, whatever. It&#8217;s the &#8220;something&#8221; that turns thoughts into activity, and it should work for all the dimensions (once we figure out the &#8220;landscape&#8221; of the dimension, anyway). So maybe this is how the so-called &#8220;law of attraction&#8221; or &#8220;law of intention&#8221; works &#8211; you trick yourself into command mode, then shift around in dimensional probability-space to a position where what you intend is more likely. It would explain why it takes a while to kick in &#8211; you&#8217;re moving, and that isn&#8217;t instantaneous.
  
In fact, you can probably only travel at the speed of light through all dimensions in which you exist, and we&#8217;re already travelling at near the speed of light through time. The speed through each dimension (vector components, if you will) has to add up to the speed of light &#8211; this is why when you get faster, time slows down (check Einstein&#8217;s theories). So if we&#8217;re moving so quickly through spacetime, we haven&#8217;t got much speed left to move through the other dimensions, right?
  
So: we can change our reality by moving around in another dimension (or more), but it will take a while to go from your current reality to a wholly new one. I also think the geometry of the higher dimensions has something to do with the versions of reality you move through &#8211; perhaps they are all curled up (like string theory suggests?), and we travel &#8220;down&#8221; and &#8220;up&#8221; in spiral fashion. Some people who experiment with intentional reality say that some time after you first form an intention you get a &#8220;little&#8221; result, followed by the major result. Perhaps the &#8220;little result&#8221; reality and the &#8220;major result&#8221; reality are on top of each other, like layers of a spring?
  
It could also explain why two different intentions (from different people) don&#8217;t cancel each other out &#8211; the two &#8220;intenders&#8221; move to different realities. e.g. We both want the same job. We both intend it equally. I move to the reality where I get the job, you move to the one where you did. In my reality, you lost out; in yours, I did.
  
Of course, that would mean we have to exist in all realities, even though we are only conscious of a single one at any point.
