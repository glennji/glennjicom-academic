Finally started my training for LPIC-1. This is going to be fun!
  
Okay, more information: after a long talk with Dee last week, I decided that I needed to get into a career that was more closely aligned with my passions &#8211; namely GNU/Linux, open source software, GNOME, Ubuntu and especially hardware and embedded systems. Now, there&#8217;s a few opportunities here in Edinburgh for exactly this kind of thing, but my work history is completely as a Java developer and so convincing people that I &#8220;know&#8221; Linux is not the easiest thing to do.
  
We decided that I should just go ahead and get Linux-certified, since that will demonstrate that I have at least a basic understanding of the system. Further, I can rewrite my CV in such a way as to highlight the &#8220;system&#8221; aspects of my experience rather than the pure Java stuff. Of course, being familiar with a couple of programming languages can&#8217;t hurt, and I do like _creating_ stuff.
  
So I&#8217;m halfway through my first pass of a LPIC-1 exam preparation book now, and once I get to the end I&#8217;m going to set a date and book the exam &#8211; which will (hopefully) force me to get into a proper study mode. Luckily I&#8217;ve got three different LPIC books to use in my preparations.
  
If it goes well I&#8217;d like to do the same thing with the Java certified developer exam, and possibly the CCNA as well (I completed a year of CCNA training back in University, after all &#8211; if only I&#8217;d sat the exam at the time!).
  
There&#8217;s also an Ubuntu exam from LPIC once I&#8217;ve done LPIC-1 and LPIC-2. Certification is fun!
