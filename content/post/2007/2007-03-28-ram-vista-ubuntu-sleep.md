The replacement RAM for my new workstation &#8220;curiousity&#8221; finally arrived yesterday, stuffed through the letterbox by the friendly neighbourhood courier to fall upon worn rental-property pile like the softest rain on virgin soils. I don&#8217;t normally get things delivered to my home address, since I&#8217;m always at work and the security entrance usually keeps the best delivery-people stranded beyond the glass; this time I was lucky that our neighbours are gutting their flat, so all the doors were propped open for the tradesmen.
  
Needless to say, I rushed home as soon as I could to install it, run some memory tests from the Ubuntu CD and then get stuck into installing Vista. Yes, Vista &#8212; I&#8217;ve had to install Windows for Danielle, traitorous though it feels to my penguiny heart. (Ironically, her first response to the new interface was, &#8220;Wow, that looks just like Linux!&#8221; My slow-but-steady subversion of her computing tastes is proceeding perfectly to plan!)
  
Once Vista was on I tried out some of the old-but-good-but-cheap games I&#8217;ve been buying of late: Deus Ex, Hitman, Neverwinter Nights, Black & White &#8230; all of them work, and they&#8217;re fun too! Once I got that out of my system it was onto the open source, cross-platform stuff (also for Dee&#8217;s mental subversion &#8212; get used to the applications and it doesn&#8217;t matter what platform you&#8217;re using): Firefox, OpenOffice.org, Inkscape, AMSN, Picasa (still to do: Gimp. What else is there? Must investigate.).
  
Tonight I&#8217;m doing the second part of the puzzle: installing Ubuntu Feisty (beta) and dual booting! This is significantly more fun for me: Compiz/Beryl, a SMP kernel, Avahi service detection, Nvidia driver &#8230; Unfortunately the first thing I need to do is get my zd1211rw-based USB wireless adapter working (found something useful on the Ubuntu forums, so should be okay).
  
It&#8217;s been a very long day. Probably should go to bed before 2am tonight. Probably won&#8217;t.
