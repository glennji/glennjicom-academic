Every now and then I stumble across something &#8212; or something stumbles across _me_ &#8212; that makes me believe that life is more than just a sequence of arbitrary occurences imposed upon me from the outside. Indeed, it seems quite the opposite &#8212; that certain things are happening for the very specific purpose of improving my existence in some way. Perhaps this actually applies to _everything that happens_, but I&#8217;m not yet able to see it?
  
An example: last night I tried writing, but got very little done. I&#8217;m trying to write a novel or three, but find that when I&#8217;m inspired, I&#8217;m not at my desk, and vice-versa. So today I&#8217;m browsing the web because, by some chance, I have little to do at work until 1pm, and I find an article describing [a simple technique][1] for avoiding writer&#8217;s block &#8212; writing as an email! This is brilliant, and simple, and obvious, and self-evident &#8230; and I never would have thought of it on my own.
  
(On the other hand, perhaps I already had. It&#8217;s altogether possible that this existence, this _samsara_, is just a dream, a reflection, flawed because I am flawed, the world seen through the unique lens of the distorting ego I call &#8220;self&#8221;.)
