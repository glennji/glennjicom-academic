I asked for an update from my manager regarding relocating to London with the company today. She passed on the request and was told that, &#8220;a relocation package may not be available for this type of move&#8221;. Whatever that means! I really do feel like I&#8217;m being shafted here at the moment &#8212; trapped in a dead-end role, given a fairly crappy pay-rise (others got worse, but I don&#8217;t see how that is really the point) and blocked at every exit. Well, every exit but one &#8212; I&#8217;m not afraid to look outside this Scottish _zaibatsu_, unlike the common &#8220;celeryman&#8221; or wageslave in the hierarchy, and I&#8217;m sure my skills are extremely exportable (if just a little rusty).
  
I&#8217;m almost hoping that Dee lands a contract quick smart so I have no choice but to force their hand &#8212; &#8220;if you can&#8217;t place me in London, I resign.&#8221; How much fun would that be?!
