I had a completely stupid night last night, followed by an equally ridiculous day.
  
I had to work, for one thing. A 20 minute job, apparently, but I was still there at 3am, 5 hours later &#8212; and was called back in when I woke after lunch time today. It&#8217;s fixed now, but why must these things be so complicated?
  
It has convinced me that I have to get a new job, however. I&#8217;m slated to move departments, so hoping that happens sooner rather than later (although despairing of it ever happening at all) and then once I&#8217;ve been there for a while I may look at moving again &#8212; I don&#8217;t know that I can do the kind of work I want to where I currently am, and the more bored I get the more my quality of work suffers.
  
Dee got word of her bonus, and it&#8217;s not too shabby (certainly worth staying until February to receive it, anyway) so we&#8217;re going out for dinner tonight. It should be enough to pay off our debts once and for all, and then we can actually start saving some pennies. Possibly towards a mortgage &#8212; a &#8220;death pledge&#8221; &#8212; but it&#8217;s not worth buying a house at the moment so we&#8217;ll just bide our time I think.
  
I need another holiday already. Stupid work.
  
**Update:** I&#8217;m back at work again, the morning after. Got here at 6:30 to run some tests and make sure everything was working (it is). Feeling a little less hostile today, perhaps because I&#8217;ve granted myself the privilege of coming to work in &#8220;casual clothes&#8221; i.e. t-shirt and jeans.
  
Dinner with Dee last night was good &#8212; an unassuming Italian restaurant in the West End. Great food (mmm, calamari) friendly service and a decent house wine. We might even go back!
