It&#8217;s Friday at last, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier. Well, actually I could &#8211; I&#8217;m technically on &#8220;backup&#8221; this weekend, so there&#8217;s a slim chance that I&#8217;ll be called to work. It&#8217;s not going to be the easiest thing, since I&#8217;m going to Glasgow for a ceilidh (is that how it&#8217;s spelt?). Lots of drinking, dancing and kilt-wearing. Even better, it&#8217;s for Dee&#8217;s work so I don&#8217;t care if I make a complete fool of myself!

I&#8217;ve hired a kilt and all the trimmings — fun!<figure class="wp-block-image">
