In light of Danielle&#8217;s recent EEG, it&#8217;s interesting (and a little scary!) to hear that games may one day soon [incorporate the same sensor technology][1] to provide a new dimension to our gaming.
  
Interesting, and not too surprising: the equipment is getting cheaper all the time. It&#8217;s the right time for the [OpenEEG][2] project then, which aims to provide opensource hardware designs and software for building EEGs &#8211; for experimentation, mental training and research. Who wouldn&#8217;t want to understand their own brain, mind and moods a little better? (Okay, probably lots of people, but I&#8217;m not one of them!)
  
I like that one of the first examples of a neurofeedback toy is a Darth Vader mask and light-saber which you have to concentrate to keep activated. Very geek.
