Okay, it&#8217;s official &#8212; our new flat rocks!
  
Today I walked into work for the second time ever. The first was Monday morning, when I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure where the building was &#8212; I walked into a gigantic bank building, straight up to reception and asked, &#8220;Is this the ${blah} building?&#8221;.
  
&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; replied the young eastern European behind the reception desk, &#8220;this is number 12. I don&#8217;t know this other building.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Do you have the Intranet?&#8221; I enquired hopefully. &#8220;I think the address is there somewhere.&#8221; Yup, should&#8217;ve written that down before I left Edinburgh, noted. After a confusing to-and-fro and much Googling, I had the address &#8212; not too far away, but I&#8217;d already been walking for about 45 minutes by this point &#8212; luckily I&#8217;d left home at about 7:30 to ensure I&#8217;d be there on time!
  
I got to the proper building and rang my contact &#8212; she wasn&#8217;t in yet! So I explored the &#8220;caf&#8221; (and found the facilities!!) and waited for her to arrive, then was shown to my temporary desk. I spent the day trying to get access to stuff, reading and (let&#8217;s face it) twiddling my thumbs.
  
Needless to say, I was a little scared off walking in again, so for the next two days I took the tube &#8212; an experience in itself! Hot, muggy, crowded, lots of steps, buskers, far too many free newspapers &#8230; but brilliant once you get into it! Everywhere is so close! The trains run every 2 or 3 minutes! After wandering around looking for housey shops at lunch time, I just jumped on the tube after work and, within minutes, found myself in the retail centre of Tottenham Court! Huzzah!
  
So I got some plates, bowls and bed linen (much needed &#8212; I spent the first couple of nights lying on the mattress with a shirt or two across my body) then whisked back home again before the sun had gone down. Of course, during summer the sun doesn&#8217;t go down until 11pm or so &#8230;
  
But today I thought I&#8217;d try walking again, as I&#8217;m finding myself a little more comfortable with the area (I still take a wee A-Z street map everywhere of course). It took 35 minutes! Along Brick Lane, a famous Indian street &#8212; I&#8217;m looking forward to the walk home tonight, and may just pick up a cheeky curry &#8230; mmmm, curry.
  
Tomorrow I meet Dee at the station &#8212; finally together again! Life is good.
