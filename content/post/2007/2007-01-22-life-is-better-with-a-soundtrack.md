I&#8217;ve had such a shitty day at work, nothing to do but have a drink and listen to some tunes, courtesy of Last.fm.
  
Thankfully this means: Beck; Depeche Mode; Yo La Tengo; Bad Religion and more random stuff. It&#8217;s not all great, but it&#8217;s all good. The wine is a french sauvignon, perfect for the evening meal of trout, steamed vegetables and pan-fried capsicum (red peppers) and spring onion. Oh, and just in case I&#8217;m sounding like a complete toss-bag, rest assured that I&#8217;m drinking the end of this wine straight from the bottle &#8211; no pretensions here, apart from an arguably excessive tendency towards loquacity. I don&#8217;t even think that is a word, however.
  
Seriously, I&#8217;m having a ball. I heard today that it&#8217;s almost bonus season, and that I should expect 10% &#8211; not too bad, not too bad at all! 10% of my yearly salary will more than pay off my credit card &#8211; yes, I&#8217;m one of the very many sad people in the world that live in debt &#8211; and also buy me a much better computer than I currently have (overclock that bitch!). If there&#8217;s any left over, well, that&#8217;s the start of my Ducati Fund. One day. I may need to fake a mid-life crisis, but one day.
  
The best part of my day today was the walk home &#8211; listening to Natacha Atlas (it&#8217;s not all in English, but I like it!) and some Augie March (good solid Australian band) &#8211; and the second best bit was the walk to work, for much the same reason. It seems that I&#8217;m highly paid for an easy job with no respect, not inside the company nor beyond. I cringe when people ask me what I do! That&#8217;s just not right!
  
Meh, I&#8217;m just being a big sook.
