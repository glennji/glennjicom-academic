<img title="Interior" src="http://glennji.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/newspic20060401-01.jpg" alt="Interior" width="200" height="300" align="right" hspace="10" />_A collection of loosely coupled network devices running a variety of collaborative and cooperative services to provide an information grid/mesh within a home environment._
  
So I&#8217;m networking my apartment, drenching it in EM radiation from access-points and wifi devices: workstations, laptops, portable gaming devices, network storage, media centres. The idea is that a bunch of individual services can be molded into a coherent data mesh, transparently offering themselves to each and every device that requires it. I call it &#8220;Haven&#8221; (i.e. house and vehicle electronic/entertainment network, a contrived acronym).
  
Eventually I&#8217;ll be porting haven to a place of my own, but in the meantime I&#8217;m trying to build up a set of cooperative devices and services, mostly GNU/Linux-based, and experimenting with human-computer interaction and information-ubiquity.
