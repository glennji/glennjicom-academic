It was almost inevitable.  My work, originally so laid-back and non-intrusive, has started ramping up and impacting my daily &#8220;surf the web, update a wiki or three, post a blog entry, eat lunch, maintain a mailing list, go home&#8221; schedule.  Ty-pi-cal.  You just can&#8217;t find a good, no-work job these days.
  
I guess I can call the first couple of weeks a &#8220;honeymoon period&#8221; and be thankful for it.
  
In other news, I&#8217;m about to enter my last year of &#8220;twenty-something&#8221; (for this lifetime at least).  Pretty exciting &#8211; I only have 12 months left to be immature and irresponsible, after which I have to settle down and buy a station-wagon or something (I&#8217;m not entirely clear on this part).  I&#8217;ve so far got an R. Buckminster Fuller book &#8211; awesome! &#8211; and Dee says she&#8217;s already got me a gift but I think she&#8217;s fibbin&#8217;.  She&#8217;ll be out tonight looking, or make an excuse to &#8220;go do the grocery shopping&#8221; tomorrow, &#8220;oh no, I&#8217;ll do it, you stay here and drink peppermint schnapps, too-roo!&#8221;
  
It&#8217;s a weird place inside my imagination, but at least it&#8217;s never dull.
