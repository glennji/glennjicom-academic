An update, in case there&#8217;s anyone who reads this and wonders what&#8217;s been going on &#8212; we&#8217;ve found a flat in London! The move is actually happening &#8230;
  
Okay, so where are we? Dee gave her notice a couple of weeks ago and so has only two weeks left (this one included), and I&#8217;ve organised to start at the London office on the 23rd July &#8230; so we&#8217;re really almost there! From so many weeks ago, thinking it would never happen.
  
Our new apartment is the top floor (I like to say &#8220;penthouse&#8221;) of a converted school in Bethnal Green. It&#8217;s smaller than our place in Edinburgh, but that&#8217;s probably to be expected &#8212; it&#8217;s the tradeoff of being close enough to the city (and therefore my new office) that I can walk, run and/or ride to work, completely avoiding the oft-maligned (with good reason!), smelly, humid, crowded rail network known universally (if not fondly) as the London tube.
  
So combine bikes with a few flights of stairs, add a wider range of eating options (I&#8217;ve never found a decent sushi place in Edinburgh, for example) and subtract the deep-fry-everything mentality of the proud Scottish capital and we should be on our way to a healthier, fitter lifestyle. Or so I hope.
  
It&#8217;s not _as_ furnished as the Edinburgh place either &#8212; I&#8217;ll be arriving a week before Dee (she&#8217;ll stay up north and sort out cleaners and movers and keys) and have the dubious joy (I&#8217;ll enjoy it, at least) of selecting the three C&#8217;s &#8212; cookery, crockery and cutlery. (Yes, Dee gets a giggle when I say that.) I also get to find and purchase a computer desk and chair &#8212; no more PCs and laptops on the dining table, coffee table or couch!
  
And so a new era begins &#8230;
  
(Too dramatic?)
