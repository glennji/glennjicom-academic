Here&#8217;s a thought: how much electricity could you get from a turbine generator placed inside an adapter roof run-off downpipe in a place as consistently rainy as Scotland? Would it be enough to trickle-charge a battery system for running throughout the day? What about if the house was kitted out with low-voltage appliances only? Is it even worth trying?
  
Personally I think there&#8217;s a potential for both water- and wind-driven turbines around here &#8212; it is so windy and so rainy that it almost seems a shame to waste all that energy! Similarly, could some small &#8220;submergables&#8221; in key locations in the Waters of Leith provide enough electricity for subdued path lighting? (It&#8217;s treacherous at night without lighting, as the tree cover hides even moonlight.)
  
Just a thought.
