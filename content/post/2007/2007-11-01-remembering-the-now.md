Two major revelations and one minor one on my walking-meditation yesterday
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1M. Non momentary-focused consciousness as a source of dissatisfaction </span>
  
This morning I was very disturbed and dissatisfied, what with not having our bond repaid and such. Largely I am yearning for the time when we are once again fiscally secure (and somewhat independent); being able to imagine/remember this makes me frustrated with the current situation.
  
For various reasons (with the iPod assisting) I brought my focus on to the very-very-now &#8212; the instant as it was occuring. I limited my thoughts to the experience of now i.e. just the sensations (music, warmth of sun, cool breeze, pleasant stretch of legs, whiff of perfume or rubbish). Suddenly I was much happier! I could find things to enjoy in the moment-to-moment. Experience without analysis.
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2M. &#8220;Now&#8221; focus as a martial art</span>
  
As I got towards work I &#8220;let go&#8221; of the reins that were keeping me in the here-and-now, letting my future-planning and past-learning faculties come back online as it were. Then I realised &#8212; the here-and-now is the same state of mind as when I practise martial arts! It is warrior-mind, zen-state, kungfu calm before the storm and calm within the storm. This meant (to me) that it was something I&#8217;d practised a lot, and I wasn&#8217;t so worried that it was a once off experience.
  
It&#8217;s always been a worry, which is silly &#8212; I&#8217;m worried that I won&#8217;t be able to not worry &#8212; so this is a big deal for me.
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1m. Music as a meditation aide</span>
  
I know I&#8217;ve said before just how much I like music, but it really does surprise me just how much I appreciate it and the positive effects it seems to have on my psychological (and therefore physical) state. For now-focus, it seems to get in and distract me from my own internal monologue enough that I can appreciate what is coming in through my senses. For moods, the right music can tune my emotional state to whatever I require.
