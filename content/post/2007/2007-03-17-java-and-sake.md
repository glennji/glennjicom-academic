I&#8217;ve installed Sun Java 5 and 6 now, and the Eclipse IDE. In theory this means I can actually start doing some coding &#8212; and on a Saturday night that means code, sake and Asahi beer! I&#8217;ve got a couple of things I can try out too &#8212; the Google API&#8217;s I mentioned in the last post, for example, and also a &#8220;live stats&#8221; style display for work that we can strategically face towards the management (when things are going well; when our uptime stats drop I will surreptitiously spin it back &#8217;round the other way). Shouldn&#8217;t take too long, and will be a good reminder about the basics.

In other news I&#8217;ve just installed a WYSIWYG editor pane for editing content on this site &#8212; not that you can see it, of course &#8212; and I&#8217;m scanning some more of our photos with the HP and Xsane. What fun!
