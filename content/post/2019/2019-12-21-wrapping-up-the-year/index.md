We made it.

It's probably the same feeling every year, but it certainly _feels_ like this one has been a tough slog. From work (what the hell??) to learning how to help Jules with dyslexia, there's been a steep learning curve for all of us this year. Not to mention all the craziness happening in the world around us: Trump, Brexit, HK, bushfires at home and "forever wars" abroad.

Of all the applicable clichÃ©s my favourite has to be "...once more 'round the sun." A seemingly unremarkable star, I might add, but for the fact that its third satellite hosts _us_; we're nothing more than the smartest hominids on the only chunk of rock that can provide life-support for our fragile bodies and interconnected ecosystem. From micro- to macro, this planet represents the only biome we know, in all its variety and variegation.

(It's a shame that so much of Australia, at least, is burning.)

So what did I get up to in 2019? I worked for awhile at a company that seems hell-bent on wasting their potential, succeeding in spite of themselves, and it made me hungry for more: if these guys can't run a technology department, well, maybe I could? I came back to my consultancy and have consistently been a _bad manager_, concentrating on the clients rather than our staff, to the point of personal embarrassment. (I _want_ to be more supportive for my team, and I'll certainly endeavour to do so in the new year, but I find it difficult on a few different levels. Perhaps if I had more time to dedicate to it? Rather than the typical "you have 20% time for team building ... but we expect the project to get delivered too. And we've underestimated, so work weekends if you can!")

Yeah, I need a break. A couple of weeks with no school, no work and nothing to do but paint wargaming minatures with Jules, mess about with Arduino, sleep, go running, write, read.
