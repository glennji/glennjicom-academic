  A quick note about this: last Friday I was home (after being sick all Thursday night), and on Saturday afternoon Dee noticed that our front window (into Jules&#8217; room) was damaged &#8212; and it clearly looked like someone had attempted to open it with a crowbar.

  We can&#8217;t say for sure when it was, but we do have a sensor light for overnight and I was totally out of it on Friday, so it was possibly during the day. Whenever it was, they damaged our windows pretty badly (but couldn&#8217;t actually get it, so winning).

  As soon as we noticed, we were off to Bunnings for an alarm. Presumably it was a &#8220;convenience crime&#8221; (well, if you carry a crowbar around with you) on our otherwise quiet street; Dee reported it to the police but they didn&#8217;t really have much to tell us.
