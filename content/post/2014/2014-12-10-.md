It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve done any Android rooting, and so I was quietly surprised at how easy it was to get Kitkat on my aging Galaxy S2 (GT-i9201T). In fact, the hardest part was getting the TWRP (Teamwin Recovery Project) installed, as Heimdall (for Mac) is broken by a libusbx bug and I couldn&#8217;t get VirtualBox, and therefore Odin, to recognise my device.
  
Any of the above sound confusing? Let me break it down into some simple steps &#8212; for future-me, if no one else.
