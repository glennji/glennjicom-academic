It&#8217;s coming together, slowly but surely: we have tickets for (some) trains in Europe, have bought and applied for VISAs on the Trans-Siberian and have booked passage on a container-ship from Singapore to Melbourne. We&#8217;ve even put accomodation ideas and prices into the [itinerary][1] spreadsheet, and the cost of (soft) sleeper trains in China &#8212; so all in all we have at least some idea of what it&#8217;s going to cost us.
