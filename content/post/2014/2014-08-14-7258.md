  Last night we drank a magnum of Mumm (champagne) that Dee won in a weight-loss competition at work, and as a result we got a little bit silly on Facebook. This in turn triggered an automatic post via IFTTT, and I feel like I should explain a little.

  It’s our third day at the beach house in Callala Bay, and I think we’re finally settling in. The town is quiet — empty, off-season — and the ocean is loud and *right there*. Jules and Lucy have been running on the beach (I haven’t) and we’re planning a whale cruise sometime, but it’s really just about relaxing and slowing down.

And drinking too much champagne.
  
Yeah, I don’t think we need to do that again. A nice day relaxing and rehydrating is in order, with a little drive to have a look around maybe.
