A quick note to remind you all how to find the Apple-specific characters on Yosemite.
  
First, bring up the character viewer by going to System Preferences > Keyboard and ticking &#8220;Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar&#8221;, then clicking the new menu bar icon (next to the clock) and &#8220;Show Character Viewer&#8221;.
  
Now you want to select &#8220;Technical Symbols&#8221; in the left-hand pane. If it&#8217;s not visible, click the &#8220;gear&#8221; dropdown above the left-hand pane and &#8220;Customize list&#8221;:

Tick &#8220;Technical Symbols&#8221; in the category list and you&#8217;ll be good to go.
