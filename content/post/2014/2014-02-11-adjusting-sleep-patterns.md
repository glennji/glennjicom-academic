Last night we took the first step on what I suspect may be a long journey: readjusting Jules&#8217; sleeping patterns.
  
We&#8217;ve fallen into just a couple of bad habits over the last six months, probably since he got sick and went off his food. Neither are particularly bad habits, but I suspect they&#8217;re still going to be tough ones to break, but worthwhile &#8212; for us, and for Jules. The primary one is that we&#8217;ve been letting him come and sleep in our bed when he wakes up overnight, usually 3am or so. The second, more subtle (but likely related) is that we&#8217;ve been staying in his room and reading to him until he falls asleep.
  
Last night Dee took point: I read to him for ten minutes, then left while he was still awake. For the next FOREVER he cried, got up, threw himself on the ground, wailed some more &#8212; and each time, Tough Mummy picked him up and put him back without a word, Super Nanny style. Each time, he wailed louder but for shorter periods, and each time he stayed closer to his own room; in the end, he would walk to the door, then put himself back to bed when Dee came towards him.
  
Same thing overnight (Dee again; it&#8217;s my turn tonight) &#8212; he got up, was put back, fought it for a while, stayed in his own bed. Quite a struggle, especially at 3am (and then again at 5am), but eventually he stayed in bed.
  
And then when I got up at 7am this morning, I saw this:
