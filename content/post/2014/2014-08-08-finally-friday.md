Freedom! Fresh-air! Family! Freezing (by the beach)! 

Sitting in the Blue Bird café (inside the same building that has delicious Vietnamese food by Miss Chu) drinking a decent (but slightly off somehow — not burnt, so maybe just cheap/crappy coffee beans?) flat-white and waiting on a chicken and avocado wrap. It’s the last Friday before two weeks leave.

Getting some work done too, which is more than can be said for yesterday’s WFH efforts. Alright, so I installed and configured rbenv and got Slogger working again, but is that really progress? Yes, I completed a couple of Watch Dog missions, but how is that helping the world?</p>
