It doesn&#8217;t take much: one smarmy bus driver and my mood has taken a dive.
  
Transport NSW (I think it is) is rolling out a new NFC ticketing system called Opal, very similar by all accounts to Myki in Melbourne (but not compatible, right?). It&#8217;s been hyped and advertised for a couple of months, with the promise that &#8220;some paper tickets will not be available after September 1st&#8221;.
  
[<img class="alignnone size-full" title="wp-1410389256546.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wpid-wp-1410389256546.jpg" alt="image" />][1]
  
Dutifully, I bought an Opal card before my last bus trip, only to find that it&#8217;s only usable on certain trips &#8211; and so far none of my buses are included. Instead, the readers have a sticker over them stating, &#8220;not in use, blah blahÂ  blah&#8221;.
  
It&#8217;s my third free trip, so I ask the bus driver, &#8220;These aren&#8217;t being used yet?&#8221;
  
&#8220;Read the sign&#8221;, he replies. The dick.
  
Bring on self-driving cars and buses, I say. Better than the self-entitled, lazy, resentful, ill-mannered, holier-than-thou cock-spanks that drive buses and taxis in this city.
  
Rant ends. I feel much better, thanks Internets!
