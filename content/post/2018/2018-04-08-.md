Hello Monday!
  
I&#8217;m feeling unreasonably optimistic again this morning, and can&#8217;t really see why (but I guess that&#8217;s the definition of &#8220;unreasonable&#8221;). Weekend was sort of typical, with no real &#8220;events&#8221; to speak of, just housework and study – oh,  did I mention I&#8217;m studying?
  
Yep, it&#8217;s true: I&#8217;m working towards a masters. An MBA in fact!
  
A single unit at a time, online, so it&#8217;s likely to take me about four years to finish  but it&#8217;s kind of great being g a student again &#8230; even if it doesn&#8217;t come with the lack of responsibility that I seem to recall so fondly of my earlier days. Assignments, reading, discussion forums – something to concentrate on apart from my day job&#8230;
