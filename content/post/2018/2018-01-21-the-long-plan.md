  Maybe I’m getting older.
</p>

<p dir="auto">
  I mean, OF COURSE that is OBJECTIVELY true, of all of us. Even if <a title="Blog post" href="http:///2007/08/24/multi-dimensional-physicality-in-a-10-d-reality/">time is multidimensional</a>, we seem to be falling <em>this </em>way at near-light speed — with no clear way to steer, let alone slow down. We each grow a tiny bit older with every Planck time clock-tick, our cells die and replenish, the pattern of “us” which arises from and is embedded in the physicality of the universe transforms and changes, like a “<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Heraclitus">river once crossed</a>&#8220;.

  But this morning I looked out at the tiny yard at the back of our Petersham rental and felt <strong>claustrophobic</strong>.
</p>

  Part of it is because of the rental property we went to look at yesterday. From the glamour-photos, likely taken when the property was “dressed” and sold, it appeared to have the features we want: cheaper rent, two bedrooms, a little office, a tiny yard with a tiny cubbyhouse. We could even live with the external laundry, lack of ducted AC, ugly-as-sin bathroom. But what the photos didn’t show was a floor with a marked <em>slope </em>in both bedrooms, to the point where I worried I’d wake up hard against the wall, having rolled there overnight. Is this place on top of a sink-hole? Are the bedrooms about to collapse into the garage beneath?

  How could anybody feel safe in a place like that?
</p>

  So it’s past time to think about leaving Inner-West Sydney, and in fact we’ve being doing that for months — see &#8220;Where should we live?” elsewhere on the site. After doing our budget a few months ago, planning our get-out-of-debt-free plan, we’ve decided to move: back to Victoria, and out on the coast rather than in Melbourne. Heaps to plan, as well as saving, so our timeline is three years.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  I’ll be doing all the planning on the <a title="Wiki page" href="http:///lexicon/otway-coast">corresponding wiki pages</a>, but in short we plan to save a deposit for a big plot of land (like 10 acres), then build a couple of tiny (and relatively cheap) kit-house cottages on it. I’ll get a shipping container and/or site office and work remotely, whilst Dee sets up the cottages for holiday rentals and, eventually, runs an eco farm-stay (with the occasional 6 to 12 month project-management/scrum-master contract as required).

  Our search for the long way home continues. Perhaps this time we’ll get it right?
