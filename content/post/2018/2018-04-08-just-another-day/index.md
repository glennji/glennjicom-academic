Hello Monday!
  
I'm feeling unreasonably optimistic again this morning, and can't really see why (but I guess that's the definition of "unreasonable"). Weekend was sort of typical, with no real "events" to speak of, just housework and study – oh,  did I mention I'm studying?
  
Yep, it's true: I'm working towards a masters. An MBA in fact!
  
A single unit at a time, online, so it's likely to take me about four years to finish  but it's kind of great being g a student again &#8230; even if it doesn't come with the lack of responsibility that I seem to recall so fondly of my earlier days. Assignments, reading, discussion forums – something to concentrate on apart from my day job &#8230;
