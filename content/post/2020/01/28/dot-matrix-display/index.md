Ahah, the build can start! The first component for a "reimagined clock radio" arrived in our absence this weekend: a LED dot-matrix display which just happens to fit very well in the space previously occupied by the radio dialer. The test-fit, seen above, shows I should be able to line-up the matrix with 

Of course, I have no idea how to use this and it didn't come with instructions, but I'm sure I can find something on the Internet.
