I arrived home Wednesday to find an innocuous-looking parcel waiting for me, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw the description on the packing slip: it's a robot! Jules and I quickly broke open the box and started looking at all the new toys and bits we would have to play with. "Let's not do it now," he said. "We can do it on the weekend." Alright buddy, we can wait ... as much as I want to get stuck into it already!

Naturally I can't help myself but get prepared, so I'm downloading all the tools and drivers and everything else we might need when building, as well as reading through the assembly guide to make sure I have it in my head. All looks pretty straightforward, so I'll leave as much of it up to Jules as he likes.
