Lots of work for Dee and I this month. I&#8217;m in Sydney every week until the end of the month, by which time we hope we&#8217;ve got our own place over here and we can just do the move. My deployment here is going pretty well, in that I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m drowning quite so much (except for the weather &#8212; lots of rain this morning, and looking that way for the rest of the week), but there is at least some chance that I&#8217;ll be working back in Canberra sooner or later &#8212; so the travel may not end just yet. Shame it&#8217;s not somewhere more interesting (although I do like Sydney).
  
So naturally I switched off the laptop and phone on Good Friday, determined to spend the long weekend at home with Dee and Jules with no cyber-augmentation or connectivity. Dee had other ideas, about the location at least, and had been looking for a place for us to get away for the weekend &#8212; and at the last minute she found the farm-stay at Neriga. Perfect for Lucy, as you may have seen on Facebook. Less perfect for us but still good: the whole place is on solar power, so our &#8220;tea and coffee making facilities&#8221; were a camp-stove on the verandah (very cool). A tiny (!!) little cottage on 2000 acres of mostly bushland, and an owner-farmer with an interesting history and pretty good cooking! There was one other couple, so we even had grown-up conversation one night (we brought Jules&#8217; crib up to the main house so he could snooze and we could enjoy a glass of wine or 7). The next night I put the fire on (and then turned it immediately down when it was waaaaay too hot) and collected dinner from the house, navigating the tricky path with a torch.
  
Relaxing, in other words. Jules had fun walking around the place with us, but it wasn&#8217;t somewhere you could take your eyes off him for a minute! Also glad we got the Jeep back, since it was at least 15km of dirt roads to get to the farm &#8212; not to mention the dirt &#8220;highway&#8221; between Neriga and Braidwood, the next town over. Even the bitumened parts of the road were pretty rough. &#8220;Les wouldn&#8217;t stand for this,&#8221; condemned Dee.
  
We&#8217;ve decided to put Baker Street back up for sale too: we&#8217;ve had a valuation done, and if we can achieve the high-end of the suggested price scale we&#8217;ll be able to pay off the mortgage, pay off our not-insignificant tax debt, and maybe have some left over for a holiday and/or the start of a new deposit. We still have tenants in the house so we don&#8217;t need to rush, but we also know these things take a loooooooong time. It was great to hear that Dee&#8217;s renovation work has added some value. (&#8220;What about that aerial? Add any value?&#8221; &#8220;I dug a hole, Dad!&#8221;) We&#8217;re a little disappointed we weren&#8217;t able to finish the place up the way we wanted, but getting it off the books (and us back into black) will be a great psychological relief.
  
Slowly getting ourselves together, but still some way to go. Really hoping we can find a great place to rent in Sydney for a couple of years, settle in and dig some roots. But we still haven&#8217;t found &#8220;home&#8221; yet!!!
