I realised I haven&#8217;t actually blogged about a move to Sydney in any detail. Here goes:
  
I&#8217;m currently spending all my time in Sydney for work, while Dee and Jules stay at home in Canberra. They&#8217;ve driven over and stayed with me a couple of times, but it&#8217;s not really sustainable &#8212; we need to put Lucy somewhere, for example, and the last three times she&#8217;s stayed in the kennel she&#8217;s come back malnourished and often with an injury requiring a vet consult. It&#8217;s also easier for me to just be in a hotel, but it makes it hard for Jules to sleep when we&#8217;re all crammed in together. So not fun: our sleep suffers, my work suffers, our relationship suffers. So for the last few weeks I&#8217;ve just been coming on my own, and while I get a lot done it&#8217;s no fun leaving my family: video calls, while good, just are no substitute.<!--more-->


  
Dee is also looking at going back to work, and with her history (Deustchebank, JP Morgan) it makes sense for us to move to Sydney, where she&#8217;ll have a much wider market. And, of course, Canberra is a small place! We&#8217;re city people, I think &#8212; I go out at lunchtime and enjoy the crowds, the vibe, the noise, the excitement. It really does make a difference, an essential one, and there&#8217;s the added bonus that my &#8220;engineer brain&#8221; recognises the higher-efficiency of urban-vs-country living. So long as we can grow some veges and find a good organic supermarket!
  
Even if I end up working back in Canberra &#8212; a good chance &#8212; then at least I can stay in the corporate apartments there, set myself up with a little &#8220;bachelor&#8217;s pad&#8221;, and not worry about bringing clothes back and forth. And, really, it&#8217;s only a 30-50minute flight, so I could probably come home a little more often (with frequent flyer points if required) if I&#8217;m travelling light. Wins, all the way &#8217;round.
  
Except that finding a house is hard. It sucks. Real estate agents suck. They&#8217;re lazy at the best of times, but the rental market at the moment is such that they literally don&#8217;t have to give you the time of day &#8212; there are only scheduled &#8220;open house&#8221; viewings, which you must attend if you want to apply (they take your name and phone; sometimes they even hand out the application forms only at the viewing). I&#8217;ve even heard stories of some agents running a &#8220;rental auction&#8221;, playing desperate renters off against each other to maximise the weekly rent!! Abhorrent.
  
So keep your fingers crossed for our latest find: a 3BR house that still has tenants in it, is managed privately (no agent!), at which &#8220;pets are welcome!&#8221;, for affordable-ish rent, 20 minutes on the bike to the city (and 26 on the bus, for lazy/rainy days), next to a park, with a backyard (but no offstreet parking), 2 bathrooms and airconditioning. And the owner may be willing to let me see the place before their open-house viewing on the weekend! In other words, everything we could possibly hope for.
  
But we&#8217;ve been disappointed before, so while you keep your fingers crossed, we&#8217;ll keep our expectations suitably low.
  
Let you know how we get on.
