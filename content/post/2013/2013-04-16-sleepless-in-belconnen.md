Glad I won&#8217;t have to do this much longer &#8211; we got the cottage in Annandale!
  
(Jules decided to wake up an hour after we went to bed, then when he finally settled it was only until 4. I got up at 4:30 &#8211; couldn&#8217;t sleep with a squirmy baby next to me &#8211; and by the time I had my shower he was asleep again. But now I&#8217;m waiting for my cab to the airport. I think its going to be a long day.)
