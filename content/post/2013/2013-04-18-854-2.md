Except it&#8217;s not that far away, now is it? Almost May already, and then it&#8217;s 5 and a half months. Yeah, that&#8217;s not long to prepare for a 20km run, let alone one with the all the devilish obstacles that TMHQ see fit to torment us with &#8230; so I better get training! I&#8217;ve had an absolutely crap week dietwise, but it means I&#8217;m feeling motivated to do better and so I&#8217;ve been sitting here watching TV and reading various sites and blogs: body-building, marathon training, mountain-biking &#8230; anything to geek-out on.
  
Last time I wrote up a calendar, crammed as many training sessions in as I could, and tried to stick to it. Even worked, for the first month and a half (lost it completely on month 3, and then it was go-time). So this time I&#8217;m thinking about a calendar but also how I can avoid losing focus. **Any ideas?**
  
There are two aspects to the challenge, and consequently two (maybe three) areas I need to train on. The first is running, which should be pretty straightforward (but still difficult) &#8212; I just need to go running 3 to 5 times a week, building up my distance and stamina. I&#8217;ve got the same C25K app that I used last time, as well as a fun little game called &#8220;Zombies, Run!&#8221;. It&#8217;s just a matter a picking the best time: when I&#8217;m not too tired, too distracted, too engrossed by the computer, too unmotivated. Dee and I talked about it tonight, and we&#8217;ve agreed to put aside 30 minutes a day each to doing something fun and physical. Exercise-alone-time.
  
The second type of training is for all the obstacles. TMHQ provides a [&#8220;boot camp&#8221; training plan][1] which seems pretty good. In theory, I could do some/all of these combined with a morning run, kind of a half-way. Especially if there is a playground or some open-air gym equipment in one of the many parks near our new place. I think having a good plan written down for that is probably important, so I don&#8217;t just try to make it up (and then feel silly, and then just stop doing it).
  
The last thing I definitely need to do is more stretching. We had a stretching class at Palantir for a while, and it was pretty apparent to the trainer that my knees were out of alignment and lacking the kind of strength I&#8217;ll need to actually run for the full 20km. (Last time I ran 5km, tops, before my knees started hurting. I ended up walking most of the course. Not this time!) She gave me some stretches to do, but I&#8217;m not going to do them unless I specifically put time aside and it&#8217;s on my training plan.
  
So that&#8217;s it. Anyone got any good advice on how to stay motivated, what exercises I should be doing, food for training? As mentioned, there are parks near our new place, and we&#8217;ve both got a Palantir gym membership (at Fitness First &#8212; still got to make sure we can use the Sydney gyms), as well as our bikes. Food-wise, I think we know what to do (even if it&#8217;s hard to do it) with good, natural food and the perfect combination of Fitbit and MyFitnessPal; provided we get decent sleep, and are together to keep each other strong, we won&#8217;t fall off the wagon. Fact is, I don&#8217;t have TIME to fall off the wagon again. **So I guess I&#8217;m hoping you can keep me on the straight and narrow!**
  
_And after you&#8217;re done &#8230; this is how a Mudder recovers:_
