I took some time this weekend to start researching and thinking about training for Tough Mudder. Turns out that reading and thinking is probably the easiest part of the whole endeavour!<!--more-->


  
This is what I&#8217;ve got so far:

  * 5 &#8220;sprints&#8221; of 5 weeks each, with a reward at the end of each
  * A sprint consists of a set of activities that I **must**Â complete (but I&#8217;m allowed to catch up if I miss a day) ala Jerry Seinfeld&#8217;s [chain method][1]
  * Each sprint is planned &#8220;just in time&#8221; (so I can tailor it accordingly &#8212; also so I don&#8217;t go &#8220;organising&#8221; mad and not actually doÂ anything)

So my first Sprint starts next Sunday, giving me this week as a kind of preparatory pre-sprint &#8212; to make sure I&#8217;ve got laces for my shoes, that my gym membership is tranferable to Sydney, that I&#8217;ve gotten back into the MFP food-recording habit, and that I can get up at 5:30am every morning without wanting to kill myself. 25 weeks really isn&#8217;t that long, I&#8217;m telling myself, and I _at least_ need to be able to run a half-marathon by October &#8212; let alone run a half marathon while covered in mud, being electrocuted and/or on fire.
  
My approach is n-fold and multifaceted. I&#8217;m starting with a ten-week (2 sprint) C210K programme, which means 3 runs a week using the Android app [RunDouble][2]. After the first week I&#8217;llÂ be adding the &#8220;[perfect posterior][3]&#8221; exercises from Four Hour Body before each run &#8212; they&#8217;re only 5 to 7 minutes, 3 times a week, as Ferriss is all about the &#8220;minimum effective dose&#8221; (MED) for results. Apart from that I&#8217;ve committed to getting 10,000 steps with Fitbit (gamification is fun!), and I&#8217;m going to give Damien&#8217;s &#8220;greasing the groove&#8221; trick a go as well. Food-wise, we&#8217;re getting back to [Clean & Lean][4] [cooking][5]Â (it will be good to break out the super-blender again), recording everything with MyFitnessPal (required for the Fitbit integration) and I&#8217;ve finally ordered the PAGG stack (4HB) &#8212; will try adding other supplements in later sprints.
  
The other aspect is embracing my inner (and outer) geek: I&#8217;ve been reading about marathon training tips, joined the &#8220;beginner triathlete&#8221; forum, browsed a body-building community page on Facebook, mapped out the nearest martial arts places and public exercise stations, and started taking notes on Wikipedia pages.
  
**Seriously, let me know if you have any advice: motivation, technique, training tips.**Â I think I stuck to my training regime solidly for a whole month last time, then waned in month 2 and completely lost it by month 3. This time I&#8217;ll be &#8220;tapering&#8221; in the latter half of Sprint #5, which seems to be the way marathon runners do it, but by then I want to be comfortably running at least 18km I reckon.
  
I&#8217;ve drawn up a [calendar][6] and an accompanying [instruction page][7]Â (both in Word docx), printed it out and will stick it up in somewhere prominent to act as a visual cue. I&#8217;m telling **you**Â so you can keep me accountable. ðŸ™‚
