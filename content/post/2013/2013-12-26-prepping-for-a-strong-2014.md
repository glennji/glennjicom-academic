I&#8217;ve been eating (and drinking!) anything and everything I can find this past month or two, with the intention &#8212; likely shared by many people around this time of year &#8212; to get back to training when the new year rolls by. And training needs a purpose, right?
  
So tonight I&#8217;ve been searching the adventure and running calendars for inspiration, and have come up with the following shortlist of events:

  * [The Tough Bloke Challenge][1] (June)
  * [Kathmandu Adventure Race][2] (August)
  * [The Sydney Marathon][3] (September)
  * [Kathmandu Urban][4] (November)
  * [Mud Run][5] (December!)

I&#8217;m particularly excited about the Mud Run, as Dee has committed herself to running it too: it&#8217;s the day before her birthday, like the Tough Mudder was for me this year (which I bailed on at the last minute &#8212; put it down to bad communication and planning) and something to train for. I&#8217;m also pretty excited about the Sydney Marathon, which sounds a lot more serious than anything I&#8217;ve entered before.
  
Now, I haven&#8217;t bought tickets for anything yet: most of the ticket sales aren&#8217;t open yet, and I need to save up some pennies anyway &#8212; each event is circa $100 (or more), so that&#8217;ll be coming out of my pocket money for a little while at least. Looking at the list above, I must confess I&#8217;m not entirely sure I&#8217;ll be able to fit all of them in &#8230; but maybe the challenge is part of the appeal? And let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s pretty easy to sit here on the couch, eating Christmas pudding and planning all this &#8212; it&#8217;s pain for my future self to deal with, not me!
