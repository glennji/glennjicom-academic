  Did I mention we got the house in Annandale?
  Yesterday I met Kate, one of the owners, and signed a 12-month lease on 301 Nelson Street, Annandale. It's expensive, but not that much more than we're currently paying in Belconnen, and we get all the benefits of living close to the city -- it's a 20-minute bike ride! -- and a lovely little community. Wide, tree-lined streets; a park just behind us; a child-care and supermarket opening up just down the road; bike paths, off-leash parks, Rozelle Bay. Everyone I've spoken to has said how nice an area Annandale is -- I can't wait to move in. Kate said that it wasn't uncommon to see neighbourhood kids playing together, running in and out of each others' houses. And that never happens in Sydney!

Did I mention [we got the house][1] in Annandale?
  
Yesterday I met Kate, one of the owners, and signed a 12-month lease on 301 Nelson Street, Annandale. It&#8217;s expensive, but not that much more than we&#8217;re currently paying in Belconnen, and we get all the benefits of living close to the city &#8212; it&#8217;s a 20-minute bike ride! &#8212; and a lovely little community. Wide, tree-lined streets; a park just behind us; a child-care and supermarket opening up just down the road; bike paths, off-leash parks, Rozelle Bay. Everyone I&#8217;ve spoken to has said how nice an area Annandale is &#8212; I can&#8217;t wait to move in. Kate said that it wasn&#8217;t uncommon to see neighbourhood kids playing together, running in and out of each others&#8217; houses. And that never happens in Sydney!<!--more-->


  
Which means only one more week of flying to Sydney, flying back to Canberra for the weekends. We move in on the 26th (or thereabouts), the day after ANZAC day. In fact, I&#8217;ve only got today, tomorrow, and three days next week away from Dee and Jules! Yay! &#8220;Settling&#8221; will be like Christmas, with so many boxes to open and sort through, including some we haven&#8217;t unpacked since Melbourne.
  
Once we do settle in, of course, I&#8217;ll be coming back to Canberra every Monday, and maybe more often if I get put on a particular project. But somehow that doesn&#8217;t seem so bad, and sooner or later we&#8217;re going to open a Sydney office (Shannon was even scoping out buildings yesterday) so our long-term plans are now based around living in Sydney. Settle, get our life back under control, save a little money. It&#8217;s a good plan!
