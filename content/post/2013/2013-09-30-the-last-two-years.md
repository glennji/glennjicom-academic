There haven&#8217;t been a whole lot of posts from me of late (where &#8220;late&#8221; translates to basically the last three years or so), and this afternoon I&#8217;ve been wondering about why that is. Sure, I&#8217;ve been busy with work, and Jules, and moving (twice!), and life &#8212; but is that a sufficiently high-truth answer? I&#8217;ve been labouring under the impression that it was, but today &#8212; working from home with a sick boy off from day-care &#8212; I&#8217;ve changed my mind.
  
See, if I&#8217;ve just been too busy to write a blog then there is no chance of me ever picking it up again &#8212; life is only going to get busier from here on in, after all, and days will only seem shorter. So maybe I can do something about my time-management, working smarter not harder blah blah blah &#8230; but then again maybe I can&#8217;t. And, therefore, the &#8220;too busy&#8221; excuse is just depressing. It also rings hollow, when I actually sit down and think about it.
  
There&#8217;s an aspect of busy-ness business, sure &#8212; we have after all moved and moved and are learning to be parents and all these regular life-impacting changes &#8212; but I also think that the reason I haven&#8217;t been writing a blog is because &#8230; I don&#8217;t know what I want to write about!
  
This site has changed over the years: from a largely geeky journal to a travel blog to a rarely-updated &#8220;look at me!&#8221; that I can push to Facebook and get comments on. Now? Not sure. I&#8217;ve tried to steer towards &#8220;settling down in Australia&#8221; &#8212; and I love living in Sydney &#8212; but somehow it&#8217;s not quite gelling for me. In the back of my mind, I keep thinking about all the &#8220;projects&#8221; &#8212; software, electronics, home maintenance &#8212; that I want to be doing and writing about, but aren&#8217;t because, well, life is busy sometimes! If I want to quickly share what we&#8217;re up to on a weekend, Facebook and Google Plus do a reasonable job. Really, _this_ site should be about deeper insights and meditations on my evolving life, but _that_ _requires more time/effort than I have surplus of at the moment._
  
So what? Do I make time? Leave it as an IFTTT-powered photo-via-Facebook blog? Or do I do something interesting enough to actually sit down and write about? Yeah, I think hopefully the latter.
  
But wait and see. I&#8217;ve got a few ideas, a few stories to tell and various dreams to dream. Cross your fingers for me that I can actually _do some stuff_ and I&#8217;ll try not to disappoint.
  
Also: happy birthday **Brother Damien**!
