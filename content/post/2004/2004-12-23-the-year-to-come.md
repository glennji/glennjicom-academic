    This will be my last post this year &#8211; Dee and I are going camping in South Australia for the next two weeks, and it&#8217;s unlikely there will be mobile phone coverage, let alone wifi internet access. Of course, it doesn&#8217;t really both either of us, and is in fact one of the reasons we are going. No communication, no computers, no technology. Time to recommune with nature perhaps. A spiritual recharge, certainly.<br /> My work has really slackened off as the end of the year draws near &#8211; not my &#8220;pay to live&#8221; work, but rather the stuff I enjoy doing, the information society work: opensource, Gnome, proof reading digital copies of classics and so on. More over, my &#8220;self interest future&#8221; work hasn&#8217;t had much focus (that&#8217;s the new business stuff with Chris), as much as I think it should.<br /> Next year we will start again. I&#8217;ll be bugging Chris a lot more, that&#8217;s one thing for sure, and meeting up with him for our regular brainstorm, planning, work session. I also want to step up the interaction level of the members of the Melbourne Open Source Meetup Group that I&#8217;m organising; maybe get some new blood in, and do something interesting with it.<br /> It can all wait until next year. First, it&#8217;s time to pack.
