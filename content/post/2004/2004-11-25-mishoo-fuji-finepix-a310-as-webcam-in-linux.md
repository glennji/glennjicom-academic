<div class="post-body">
  In the spirit of biting off more than I can chew, I&#8217;m considering jumping into getting my Finepix S7000 to work as a V4L device!<br /> It&#8217;s well beyond my current capabilities (but not beyond learning!), and that&#8217;s probably the main reason that I want to try. The second reason is that I want a webcam that I can use in Linux, and I&#8217;ve already got the camera, so why not? There are a few comments on the site from fellow S7000 owners offering help, but no one has taken up the banner yet.<br /> I&#8217;m not going to get into it blindly, of course &#8211; I&#8217;ve already got too many opensource projects running to start trying to evangelise another &#8211; but I might download the example code, and the utilities, and have a bit of a hack over the weekend. In between doing all the other stuff I want to get done (seeÂ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041127130703/http://kiltedaussie.blogspot.com/">kiltedaussie</a>) &#8230; which might mean that I don&#8217;t do anything, in which case I won&#8217;t be posting the code on Sourceforge!!<br /> But I&#8217;d like to. ðŸ™‚
