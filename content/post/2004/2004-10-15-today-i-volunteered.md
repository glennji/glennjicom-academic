    Today I volunteered myself as the new maintainer of a Gnome project, gnome-utils. Of course, by the time I shot the email off there had already been several other offers, butÂ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041113231750/http://www.gnome.org/~gman/blog/">Glynn Foster</a>kindly suggested that having a couple of maintainers might be a good idea. Nice, considering he doesn&#8217;t know me at all and I haven&#8217;t given much to Gnome as yet. Reputation takes time, as always.

    However, it reminded me of the gdict Gnome dictionary software, which is part of gnome-utils. At uni I used the dictionary all the time, looking up words like a crazy loon just to avoid studying. Now I&#8217;m trying to teach myself Mandarin Chinese, so something that I could use to look up hanzi would be very helpful.

    Glynn has suggested that the dictionary shouldn&#8217;t actually be a separate app, but rather a backend for Dashboard/Beagle. This also works for me, because I&#8217;m trying to get some .NET exposure at work (Dashboard is Mono) just to learn something other than Java. And hey, that works in with the SyncML project that Warrick and I are working on. Well, thinking about. Well, talking about at the pub at least.
