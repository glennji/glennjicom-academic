    It&#8217;s another grey and rainy monandaeg in Melbourne, Australia, which is perfect weather for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041113224057/http://kiltedaussie.blogspot.com/2004/07/fun.html">writing in a blog or two</a>. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m at work, so my writings today are on borrowed time (whilst compiling, for example, or sitting in another boring meeting).<br /> I&#8217;ve been thinking for a little while about what I actually believe in &#8211; philosophically, theosophically and spiritually I guess. What I see as core truth in all spiritual teaching. It&#8217;s hardly surprising that there really isn&#8217;t all that much:<br /> 1. There is an unknowable first cause, called the Father or Monad or Tai-ji. The first cause is not sentient in anyway that we can relate to. It is the process, the evolution, the unfolding.<br /> 2. From the first cause, there is an Omega consciousness. The Omega is self-aware and omnipresent but not omnipotent. It is what is usually meant by &#8220;God&#8221; (in the Western Christianity at least, which is what I have the most experience with). Everything is part of the Omega, and the Omega is part of everything.<br /> 3. There is an invisible reality that we call the &#8220;metaphysical&#8221;. The metaphysical and the physical are closely related and affect each other all the time. Our minds are part of the Omega consciousness and exist in the metaphysical.<br /> 4. Reincarnation happens. A lot. It is an important part of the evolution of reality, a natural part of the first cause unfolding.<br /> That&#8217;s about it. Not much as I said, but that&#8217;s about all I can say that I believe in. So far, everything I have read has been moving in that particular direction, and so now I&#8217;m just trying to extrapolate, or discover the &#8220;rules of reality&#8221; as it were. Or &#8220;how to practise&#8221;. Or even just how to live.
