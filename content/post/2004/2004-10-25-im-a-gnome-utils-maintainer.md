  Yes, it happened &#8212; I&#8217;m one of four co-maintainers for the gnome-utils project (which encapsulates a number of individual apps). Quite happy about this, as I&#8217;ve been using and playing with Gnome since I first got started with Linux circa 1996 (8 years! Can you believe it?!). I&#8217;ve always thought it was the future desktop, and the whole project structure appealed to me, but I&#8217;ve never had time to put in the effort of developing anything for it.

  Now that&#8217;s all changed. At the moment, I&#8217;m really doing administrative tasks, as my C coding was an age ago, and my GTK non-existant. But that&#8217;s okay, I like doing stuff like that, and in my (so-called) spare time I&#8217;m trying to read up on GTK tutorials, and especially Java-gnome (since I&#8217;ve been a Java developer for the last 5 years). I&#8217;ve also been on the mailing lists for a while now!<br /> Next, I&#8217;ll install <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041127130703/http://www.yoper.com/">Yoper</a> and start making Gnome packages for it. Yoper seems quite good to me &#8212; somewhere between SuSE/Redhat/Mandrake and Gentoo (the hackers Linux!). There&#8217;s not too much Gnome support in Yoper yet, it seems, but that&#8217;s another reason I should get on board quickly.<br /> Personally, I&#8217;m interested in a couple of the apps from gnome-utils. gdict, the Gnome Dictionary applet (which should probably really be in gnome-applets, but hey) could use multiple DICT server support, and then it could (in theory) act as a multilingual translating dictionary (not phrases, but certainly single words). As I&#8217;m (on and off) trying to teach myself Mandarin Chinese, this would be rather helpful! Another gnome-utils app in a similar vein is gucharmap, the character map. I&#8217;m sure you can see why this might be interesting. I&#8217;m thinking that (if I&#8217;m up to it) adding personalised character sections might be useful &#8212; you know, you can make your own section and call it &#8220;Calculus&#8221;, then put all the characters that are useful in calculus into it.<br /> On step at a time, of course! But for me &#8230; it&#8217;s &#8220;happy hacking&#8221; ahead!<br /> (If only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041127130703/http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/lol/life.html?n-7112">RL</a> work was a little better! Sigh! Fjord!!)
