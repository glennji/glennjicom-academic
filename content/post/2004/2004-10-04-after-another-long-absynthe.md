    The human mind is quite amazing. On the one hand, I can&#8217;t remember things like, &#8220;call the doctor for an appointment&#8221;. On the other, I can remember my username and password for this website, 3 months later. I don&#8217;t know why that would be, but I suspect it&#8217;s to do with the relative personal value I associate with each task (to which the memory is related). Going to the doctor has low associated value, but writing in a weblog has high value.<br /> Although if writing in a weblog really had such high personal value attributed to it, I probably would&#8217;ve done it sooner than 3 months ago, hmm?<br /> Work is annoying at the moment. I think I&#8217;m sick of thinking too much perhaps? It&#8217;s not overly stressful (well, it is, but I&#8217;m not really one to take it on board &#8230; much), but it takes up so much of my time!! The travel time alone is an hour each way, and the Bossman expects us to be in around 8:30, and not leave until 5:30 (although he does usually head out earlier than that). So I end up trying to get up at 6:30, leave at half seven, and I&#8217;m usually not home again until 6:30.<br /> Then with household duties, shopping, and a little television, the day is over and I&#8217;ve achieved nothing.<br /> I think this is a common problem, but what do you do about it?<br /> More thought required. Now I have to go to work.
