<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Dee is considering selling her car &#8211; it&#8217;s an almost-new Toyota Celica ZR, black, with all the bells and whistles. As such, we&#8217;ve got a fairly large car loan currently hanging over our heads, and I think it has been stressing her out somewhat. Naturally. Anyway, now she&#8217;s talking about selling the car, paying off the loan and getting something cheaper but still fun, such as this 1966 MGB.</span>
  
<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Now, I&#8217;m all for this: I&#8217;ve wanted an MG for a long time now (an Austin Healey, actually, but they&#8217;re so close it doesn&#8217;t matter).  One of the &#8220;bosses&#8221; of an old workplace once ridiculed me for wanting a convertible as a first car.  &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be practical,&#8221; he said.  Of course, he bought some girly car, new, so I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s really the best source for advice about motor vehicles.</span>
  
<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">The only real problem would be my ego &#8211; letting Dee buy the car, but treating it as my own.  In theory, all our money is together in a big pile, to share and share alike.  But I&#8217;m a male, so the ego and protectiveness and provider nature all crowd inside my mindspace and vy for attention.</span>

    I think I&#8217;ll be able to deal with it.  After all, we would get a manual transmission, and Dee really only drives automatic (which would change, of course, but by then I should be the number one driver).Exciting times perhaps?
