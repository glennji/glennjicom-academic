    I&#8217;m in IT &#8212; in fact, I&#8217;m a computer programming (of all things).<br /> Today I got to work after a glorious long weekend (spent camping on the coast: drinking, reading, smoking, eating, talking and playing cards &#8230; in short, bliss) to find that not only did nothing work, everyone thought it was my fault.<br /> Okay, I&#8217;m dramatising. In actual fact it was one of my team members insinuating that I had &#8220;dropped the ball&#8221; on this one. First, I turned up at 15 minutes after 9 (that&#8217;s late in her books, since she arrives at a ridiculous 7:30 am); then the bug I&#8217;ve been looking at for the last <em>forever</em> days isn&#8217;t fixed, and has been found by our client-tester (bad me).<br /> Don&#8217;t worry that it&#8217;s a known issue. Don&#8217;t worry that I stay until 5:30 (or 6 o&#8217;clock tonight) each night. <em>sigh</em><br /> Luckily, when we tried it in a different application server, the problem disappeared (as well it should &#8212; I can&#8217;t see anything that would cause the problem &#8230; of course, I don&#8217;t have the source code of a particular database server, so I can&#8217;t be sure *grin*).<br /> In the end, moving to the new application server was the best for everyone. I got my bug solved, and some other bugs disappeared at the same time, leaving me with almost nothing to do &#8230; except prepare for the next version release on Friday.<br /> Can&#8217;t wait; it&#8217;ll be a hoot.
