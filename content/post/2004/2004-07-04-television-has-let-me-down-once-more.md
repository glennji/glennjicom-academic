  It&#8217;s Sunday night and I&#8217;m watching the Big Brother eviction &#8211; pathetic, yes? I&#8217;m not sure how it is in other countries, but in Australia the magic of &#8220;Reality TV&#8221; has well and truly worn off. We&#8217;ve seen about 5 series of Big Brother, Australian Idol, Popstars (the Australian Idol copycat &#8211; or is it the other way around?), not to mention at least 3 different &#8220;home renovation&#8221; shows (like &#8220;The Block&#8221;).

There&#8217;s a morning show here, quite popular I think, that tried a Reality TV-like segment &#8230; it lasted a day before a negative audience response told them that it wasn&#8217;t the right thing to do. A day! If I could watch just one &#8220;summary&#8221; episode of Big Brother and be done with it, I would.</span>

  <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Same goes for the Simpsons, actually. I&#8217;d almost rather watch old Seinfeld reruns (for about the 15th time) than another episode of the Simpsons. That said, it&#8217;s STILL the best thing on Melbourne television. It&#8217;s just not fair.</span>
