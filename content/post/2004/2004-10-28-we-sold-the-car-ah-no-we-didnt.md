A slight backwards step today when the guy lined up to buy Angelina (the Celica) reneged on the deal &#8212; I guess he &#8220;didn&#8217;t have the minerals&#8221;, or something like that. It&#8217;s a bit disappointing, because I want all the loose ends tidied up as soon as possible. Of course, it&#8217;s more important that Danielle be happy, and she seems okay &#8212; &#8220;These things happen for a reason.&#8221;
  
Very mellow indeed!
  
I still haven&#8217;t found my passport application form, so tomorrow I might try to pick up a new one, then get the photos done. (I just asked Dee, and she can&#8217;t find her passport, so neither of us are going anywhere in a hurry!) I&#8217;ve started my resum√©, which is good, but it&#8217;s not ready for sending yet. Perhaps this weekend!
  
Oh I can&#8217;t wait for the weekend.
