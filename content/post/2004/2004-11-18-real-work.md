With exams over I can finally get on with the real work ofÂ living.
  
It&#8217;s a weight off my chest, that&#8217;s for sure. And I&#8217;m actually excited about just how much more I can do with my time, now that I don&#8217;t have to waste all my free time feeling guilty about not studying. I&#8217;m off to Chris&#8217;s place this weekend for exactly that &#8211; figuring out what we can do with our time.
  
There&#8217;s a few projects I&#8217;m involved in, so I doubt I&#8217;ll be bored (well, bored for lack of things to do at least). Gnome-utils, FEED (or FED), Glennji.com, syncsite and followsam will be fun (more when I get them going, promise) &#8230; and then there is the all-important job of figuring out new stuff to do.
  
I really can&#8217;t wait.
