<p class="post-title">
  I may be looking for new work soon.
</p>

<div class="post-body">
  Wait, that&#8217;s not true &#8212; I will be looking for new work, and am currently. What I meant was: I may be out of work soon. It&#8217;s a matter of urgency, really *grins*. Not part of my masterplan, but it might be unavoidable with the way things have been going at work.<br /> How so? Well today the Managing Director was given the arse. <em>Managing Director.</em><br /> (For anyone from outside of Australia needing translation at this point: &#8220;given the arse&#8221; means that he was fired, made redundant, asked to leave, whatever you want to call it, he&#8217;s gone.)<br /> About a week ago one of the developers was fired, now the MD &#8212; who&#8217;s next? I&#8217;m guessing the most recently employed. Or the one who&#8217;s project is wrapping up. Or the one who&#8217;s skillset isn&#8217;t inline with the future direction of the (and I use the term loosely) &#8220;company&#8221;.<br /> All me.<br /> May be time for my next exciting adventure?
