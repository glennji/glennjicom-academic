Late last year a friend pinged me a link to [Tough Mudder][1], and on the spur of the moment I agreed to become his teammate in this mad-cap dash over, under and through various muddy obstacles: 20kms of commando crawls, tyres runs, tunnel crawls, wall scaling, rope bridges, log hauls, greased monkey-bars and a final high-voltage wire sprint. Fun, right?
  
Once signed up I haven&#8217;t allowed myself to consider not finishing, and fear of the event has had me up almost every morning for a run or body-weight circuit &#8211; 6 days a week in fact, with just a single morning off. I&#8217;m about halfway through the C25K programme now, and feeling fitter than I have in a while &#8211; although my beer belly is persistent! I&#8217;ll get you, belly. Anyway, it&#8217;s not so much about losing weight for me, although that will hopefully be a nice side effect &#8211; it is about finishing the Mudder with my team mates, doing something that in 2011 seemed all but impossible.
  
I&#8217;m not a natural runner. I&#8217;ve mostly forgotten how to swim. I couldn&#8217;t run up a hill without getting out of breath, let alone do it while carrying a log on my shoulder. But come 2 months time that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m going to do!
  
Diet-wise I&#8217;ve been trying to stick to 1600kcals of high-protein, low-carb &#8220;food is fuel&#8221; &#8211; lots of steak, salmon, lentils, kidney beans and diced tomato, as well as a protein shake for breakfast before exercise. My weight seems to have &#8220;stuck&#8221; at around 92kg last week, so I&#8217;m trying to keep better track, get more sleep and drink much more water.
  
Tomorrow &#8211; February 1st &#8211; means a new &#8220;stage&#8221; for me, so tonight I&#8217;m doing up a new training calendar. I have basically missed one day in January (and subsequently made it up) so it is times to increase my training I reckon.
  
Can&#8217;t wait! So excited about this!
