Last night we had dinner with Dee&#8217;s brother Chris, who is in Melbourne for work, at a trendy Smith St caf√©/restaurant called Gigibaba &#8212; expensive but delicious!
  
We picked him up around 4 and headed into Collingwood, stopping oh-so-briefly at a skate shop on Brunswick St to buy some bitchin&#8217; baby threads &#8230; strange, but once you get past the boards and rolling gear at the front there&#8217;s a little &#8220;kids&#8221; section at the back, featuring some very cool stuff from Paul & Paula: hoodies with dinosaur heads or sharks, cool little jeans. It&#8217;s like [Etsy][1] &#8211; they&#8217;re one-offs, and custom sizes can be ordered &#8211; but you can see the clothes before you buy them.
  
A quick coffee in [The Fitz][2] and we headed to Smith St, found a park and had a wander. Smith St: we pull up across the road from a &#8220;happening&#8221; &#8212; music thrashing, leather jackets clinking, Mohawks, er, _mowing_. &#8220;That&#8217;s not where we&#8217;re eating, is it?&#8221;
  
Thankfully not: Gigibaba was a tiny little place half a block up that served _meze_ sized Turkish food: kebap, sausages, baba ganouj. Apparently it&#8217;s hard to get a spot, as they don&#8217;t do bookings and most of the seating is along the bar. Despite their rep, we got a table with room for Jules&#8217; pram, admittedly when they opened at 6 &#8212; and the food was delicious. Expensive, but delicious.
  
We ate, ordered more, ate more, repeat &#8230; eventually we were full enough to resist the burger joint next door, so headed off, sated and done for the night. It was fun!
