A lot has been happening. So much, in fact, that I haven&#8217;t found the time (and energy) to document it &#8212; our &#8220;long way home&#8221; has taken an unexpected turn with a new job and life in Canberra. Let&#8217;s see if I can catch up on the last couple of months.
  
So first, the job: Palantir. Named after the scrying stones (think &#8220;crystal ball&#8221;) of Tolkien&#8217;s hobbit mythology, we are a software company with an amazing knowledge management and analysis platform which has application in a number of industries: intelligence, military, finance, health, law-enforcement, more. Our engineers are the best and brightest in the world, the geek-elite, and I&#8217;m just so proud that I made it through the rigorous testing process to join the team that I can&#8217;t even explain it. This is the job of a lifetime, and a chance to make some real positive difference in the world.
  
n00bs start their tenure with Palantir in the head-office(s) at Palo Alto &#8212; i.e. Silicon Valley!! For any geek, this is an amazing opportunity, and three weeks in the Valley is enough to make you believe you can start your own ${anything}, just as long as you drink enough coffee before breakfast. It was a great time for me, made even better by the fact that Dee and Jules flew over to join me.
  
We didn&#8217;t get to see much, admittedly, but we took our two weekends and headed into San Francisco on the CalTrain (an experience in and of itself). Took a cable-car, ate at Pier 39, drank coffee at a real diner, drove over the Golden Gate during the only fog-free window of time there&#8217;s been in the last 25 years &#8230; heady stuff indeed. I&#8217;ve got some photos somewhere; I&#8217;ll try upload them (reminds me: I&#8217;ve switched from Flickr to Picasa and there are probably broken image links all over the place. Added to &#8220;Someday/Maybe&#8221;!).
  
Once we got back to Australia, it was the shortest goodbyes to Melbourne and a two-day drive up here to Canberra. We stopped overnight in Orbost, met a lovely (and eccentric?) couple running the hotel there, then got into Canberra in the late afternoon.
  
Unfortunately we had to drop Lucy at the &#8220;Dog &#8216;otel&#8221; kennels, as she&#8217;s not allowed to stay with us in the corporate apartments, but we&#8217;re desperately searching for a place of our own (rental) so we can get her back home with us. (Visited her, and she&#8217;s loving it &#8212; running around a massive fenced paddock complete with pond/dam. Still nice to have her home.) Canberra, it seems, doesn&#8217;t like dogs &#8212; we&#8217;re looking further and further out of &#8220;Civic&#8221; (central) as we&#8217;re knocked back for properties time and time again.
  
(Fingers are crossed: a place we saw yesterday is a bike-ride away from work, a walk away from the Belconnen mall, and a toddle away from the Early Learning Centre. Been available for a while, relatively expensive and the agent rang my work within 10 minutes of receiving our application.)
  
So that&#8217;s the Cliff&#8217;s Notes version of our life at the moment. Everything feels very temporary, we&#8217;re living out of suitcases for longer than I&#8217;d expected and we miss our little puppy. It seems our the journey &#8220;home&#8221; wasn&#8217;t over after all!
