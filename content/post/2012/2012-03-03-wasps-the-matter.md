It started one morning &#8212; Dee came out to find a bunch of dead wasps in the sink, with a whole lot more (alive) outside the kitchen window. We investigated (well, Dee investigated, she&#8217;s braver than I) and realised they were flying in and out of a hole in one of our weatherboards &#8230; awww crap, we have a wasps nest!
  
It got worse as the day went one: we could hear them inside the walls, crawling over each other, rustling and chittering. (Okay, maybe not chittering &#8212; but rustling! Definitely rustling!) Too, too creepy: we called an exterminator and were very happy to hear he could come that same day.
  
The actual &#8220;extermination&#8221; took about 15 minutes, and most of that was the guy getting into and out of his biohazard suit. He then told us a delightful tale about a Thai rip-off merchant, how to get out of speeding fines, and his attempts to form a kingdom of one. But by the evening, no more rustling!
  
We&#8217;re getting a few quotes to do the whole house and surrounds now, kill everything and dissuade it from coming back.
