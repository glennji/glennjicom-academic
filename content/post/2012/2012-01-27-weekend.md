The weekend is here, finally.
  
We finished work a little early tonight to take a quick spin to Knox &#8211; we completed our cutlery set, and Dee got some cupcake baking trays, whilst I splashed out on some running gear. The guy in the Mountain Designs shop had even heard of the ToughMudder course!
  
Two more months of training for me, then: I&#8217;m nowhere near ready yet but I can already see an improvement, and I&#8217;m totally psyched about doing it! We&#8217;re going to head down to Phillip Island on the Friday (run is on Saturday morning) with my two team-mates, maybe stay &#8217;til Sunday to make a weekend of it &#8211; a muddy, freezing, exhausting weekend!
  
Tomorrow we might have a friend or two over for a barbeque lunch I reckon. Saturday is my Cheaturday &#8211; a day to refueling on carbs and eating/drinking those things I&#8217;ve denied myself during the week &#8211; so at the very least I will have some chocolate and beer. Probably not at the same time.
  
Plans for the weekend?
