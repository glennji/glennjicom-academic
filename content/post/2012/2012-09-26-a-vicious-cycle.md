I rode home from work for the first time tonight. It was not an unbridled success.
  
Oh, nothing too dramatic &#8211; I just need a hell of a lot more practice, both at cycling and at navigation. A couple of needless detours, a good long stretch riding in the bike lane on the wrong side of the road &#8230; and a failure to realise that the good ol&#8217; University of Canberra has a massive great hill in the middle of it, and &#8220;cutting through&#8221; might be less of a shortcut than anticipated.
  
My bike served me well, although I&#8217;m still not convinced I have enough air in the tyres. Bought a front light today, to go with the tail-light I got earlier in the week, and since Palantir have given me a new phone I&#8217;ve got an Android bike computer just waiting to be charged &#8211; if it&#8217;s not geek it&#8217;s meek, I say.
  
My bike probably needs a service, so i may have to do that next week. Dee thinks the knobbly mountain bike tyres might be making things harder, too, and we&#8217;ve seen the coolest baby bike seat in Costco &#8230; shopping on the weekend, then?
  
Out was very hard work tonight, harder than it ought to be. Oh well, at least I did it; I&#8217;ll get better in time. Might wait till next week to try again, however &#8211; give my legs (and bum!) time to recover.
