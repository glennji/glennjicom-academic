Hey Internets, how ya been?

Been a busy couple of months for us, as it turns out. First and very much foremost, we had a baby! Jules Franklin Mason weighed in at 3,686g on the 29th July, 51cm tall and full on beans. (The beans were later removed and we were allowed to take him home.) Almost three months later and it is an ongoing journey of discovery and sleepless nights, as anyone who&#8217;s had kids or insomnia can tell you!

Just wanted to check in quickly, joy.
