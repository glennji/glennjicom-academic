This morning&#8217;s ultrasound (mostly) confirmed it &#8212; we&#8217;re having a boy. &#8220;And there,&#8221; our sonographer commented blithely, &#8220;is the third leg!&#8221; It took us a moment to decode what she was saying, as she went on to explain that it wasn&#8217;t 100% certain but she was pretty sure what she was looking at (we couldn&#8217;t tell, mind you). No chance of a closer look, mind you: as soon as she saw it he proceeded to push the umbilical-cord between his legs and cover himself up. Modest, it seems. More modest than his daddy, that&#8217;s for sure.

As we walked out we had to admit: we&#8217;d thought we were having a girl. Don&#8217;t know why, really, but now we&#8217;re re-adjusting to reality and scrapping every bit of (unspoken) planning we&#8217;d each done. Hmm, names!?

Very happy to see the li&#8217;l guy. I wonder if we get another ultrasound before we see him face to face?
