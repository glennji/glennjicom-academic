My "overloading" experiment is over now it&#8217;s Friday, and the results are interesting, if not particularly clear-cut. Every day this week I&#8217;d intended to:

  * write some FOSS code
  * do 20 minutes practise each of French and ("Mandarin") Chinese
  * stick 100% to the "Four Hour Body" diet outlined by Tim Ferriss

&#8230; as you may recall (or as we call it in the 21st Century, "Google") or read in my previous post. Of those three, I only managed to stick to the #4HB diet every day; coding after a day staring at Ant build files and finding 40 undisturbed minutes everyday proved too difficult. (I do find it interesting that the only weekly-goal I actually achieved was a modification of existing behaviour rather than a new habit &#8212; we all gotta eat. Perhaps that&#8217;s the key?). The other goals weren&#8217;t an unmitigated disaster, mind you: I did a couple of sessions of French (with [Anki][1]) that I wouldn&#8217;t have done otherwise, and revisited my [43 Things Android app][2] workspace, although didn&#8217;t add any new functionality.

Despite this, I felt brilliantly productive in everything else I touched. I put a particularly long session into work on Thursday and was positively bouncing off the walls with excitement when I got my development workflow running _just right_. A bunch of names for the geeks: [Gerrit][3] & [Git][4], [Ivy][5], [Ant][6] and [Jenkins][7] &#8212; precommit CI builds, code-review gatekeeping, static analysis and code-coverage. Really, all that&#8217;s missing is a highly-visible status screen, a promotion of builds workflow and automated deployment to dev, test, regression, staging and finaly production. "Continuous delivery", baby!! Our bedroom is looking good, thanks to Dee, and I&#8217;ve installed XBMC on the little media centre in the wall AND built a MythTV server out in the lab.

I monitored my weight every morning at the same time this week too, and noticed zero change. Our scales measure weight and attempts to guesstimate body-composition using electrical resistance &#8212; not accurate, but accurate enough for monitoring if you&#8217;re consistent &#8212; and neither my weight or body-fat content changed any more than can be attributed to "noise". Today my body-weight is just slightly up from Monday&#8217;s figure, unsurprising after the _quantity_ of food I devoured for yesterday&#8217;s "1 day-off gluttony" (as recommended by the Four Hour Body, no cheating). Considering the _quality_ of yesterday&#8217;s diet &#8212; pancakes, bacon, maple-syrup, a Dairy Bell icecream, 6 chicken nuggets, Doritos, a glass of champagne three of rum &#8212; I would also expect my weight to creep up for a few days this week (but hopefully plummet after that). We&#8217;ll see.

So this week I&#8217;m going to slightly shift my overloading goals:

  * add the missing database methods to 43 Thing app
  * take Lucy for a 30 minute walk in the morning, and play with [AnkiDroid][8]
  * stick 100% to the "Four Hour Body" diet outlined by Tim Ferriss
  * no cheeky white coffees (I had 3 last week), and drink 3L water every day
