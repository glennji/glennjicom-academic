After a torrential downpour last night, it looks to have cleared up nicely for Isaac&#8217;s birthday in the park.

We&#8217;re running late, of course &#8211; after the work Christmas dinner on Friday night and an Audrey Tatou movie on Samedi, I was wiped out this morning. Lucky for me Dee is so capable &#8211; she not only managed our babies (one small, one large and furry) effortlessly, she brought me breakfast in bed AND finished our De Blob 2 game on the Wii! A guy couldn&#8217;t ask for more&#8230;

We arrive just in time to sing &#8220;happy birthday&#8221; and watch Isaac cut the cake; he immediately resumes his tireless play, from bubbler to spinny-roundy thing, haring around the park with nary a backwards glance at nap-time. Good to see he&#8217;s enjoying himself!

Take turns holding other peoples&#8217; babies for a while, then time to head back home. I&#8217;m still so tired that I may well have an afternoon nap; more likely I&#8217;ll do something mostly brainless, like play a game or do some Euler programming.
