See, we bought a table from Freedom Furniture the other week only to be told a few days later that we would have to wait until 2012 for delivery &#8212; and since the original estimate was two weeks, and we&#8217;d paid in full, we were far from happy. (Not unhappy enough to cancel the table altogether, mind you: we&#8217;d bought matching chairs from a different store after all.)

So we ranted and raved to each other, finally deciding to &#8220;send a stern letter&#8221; via Freedom&#8217;s website. Crafted something beautifully demanding, then followed it up with a phase-two assault email when our first only elicited a form-response &#8212; and it worked! This morning I received a timid, optimistically hopeful phone-call from Freedom telling us our new dining table will be delivered Thursday-week, for free.

Old-man-yelling-at-the-telly WIN!
