What a year.
  
In the last rapidly-accelerating twelve months we moved into our own house, bought the biggest, sookiest dog known to humankind and had a son &#8212; although &#8220;had&#8221; is past-tense and he&#8217;s undeniably more of a handful here on the outside! I flick back through the pages here and it&#8217;s like taking a trip down memory lane, only it&#8217;s via Google Street-View.
  
But it is the next 12 that I&#8217;m looking forward to, however: renovating, working hard to diversify, going camping and watching little Jules grow and grow. He&#8217;s already amazing, of course, but just listening to him make ever more complex noises (i.e. proto-speech) is humbling, scary, brilliant &#8212; and wait until he starts walking! (Sometimes we speak to each other and say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait until&#8230;&#8221; but we really CAN wait &#8212; even realising he&#8217;s outgrowing some of his clothes is a shock.)
  
Rather than any &#8220;new year&#8217;s resolutions&#8221;, I&#8217;m setting myself three impossible tasks (and several unlikely ones). The way I&#8217;m soft-wired, you tell me something is impossible and I just want to get in there and try it; so this way I&#8217;m hacking myself. Turns out it seems to work even when you consciously KNOW (but don&#8217;t dwell on the fact that) it&#8217;s a hack attempt!
  
My three impossible things are:
  
**3. Get hyperfit**
  
I&#8217;m losing weight at the moment, which in itself is pretty amazing for this time of the year, thanks to the combination of various Internet forums, Tim Ferris and myfitnesspal.com. Today I weighed in at 89.8kg &#8212; the first time I&#8217;ve been below 90kg for years, and possibly finally breaking through the &#8220;barrier&#8221; that&#8217;s had me drifting between 91kg and 94kg on every other &#8220;healthy eating/diet change&#8221; I&#8217;ve tried before. Better than that, my body-fat percentage (according to our WeightWatchers scales: inaccurate, but consistent) is a little above 29% &#8212; when previously it&#8217;s read 30+.
  
But I want to do more than just shake this office-worker beer-belly off, so next year I intend to introduce more exercise (hiking, cycling, body-weight exercises) and get that percentage as low as it can go. Hyperfit: that level of fitness that professional (or at least semipro) athletes achieve in the course of training for their sport, like wiry marathon runners or muscle-clad MMA fighters. Yeah, it&#8217;s an ongoing thing &#8212; use it or lose it &#8212; but getting down to less than 10% body-fat (and building a little muscle) should put me around 75kg, which is respectable for my height and build.
  
**2. Publish Android**
  
This is something I&#8217;ve been intending to do since before we left London (!!). It&#8217;s very hard to find the time, after a long day in front of a computer, to sit down in front of a computer. Key here is Dee&#8217;s backing &#8212; this is the way to get a little money in, eventually, so if that means we have to have a design session rather than watching _How Clean Is Your Kitchen_ then so be it.
  
We&#8217;ve got so many ideas for apps &#8212; ironically, one in stalled-progress is for making new year&#8217;s resolutions &#8212; and my professional experience/history should make me an ideal candidate for &#8220;garage-startup mobile-app development house&#8221;, so this the most important activities for this impossible thing are scheduling and prioritising against other activities. Time to be a &#8220;productive procrastinator&#8221;!
  
**1. Speak French**
  
Another impossible thing &#8212; impossible to find the time to actually practise, and practise is what makes possible (if not perfect). We have so many _livres et CDs et materiel fran√ßais_ it is just ridiculous that we DON&#8217;T already speak French, but hey, like anyone we take the easy way and nothing is forcing me to learn &#8230; except myself. So I&#8217;m planning how to structure and schedule my sessions, gathering Internet links and books, and really intend to attain a basic level of comprehension &#8212; to watch a film without subtitles.
  
So they&#8217;re my three impossible things, and now I&#8217;ve told the world about them I guess I better actually make some progress. There&#8217;s always a danger in putting up something like this: the pressure can backfire, especially on me and my peculiar rebellious mindset, and there can be a tendency (again, for me anyway) to mentally tick-off a task, and therefore forget about it &#8212; it&#8217;s someone elses&#8217; responsibility &#8212; once I&#8217;ve told someone about it. This is, I think, why so many good ideas talked about in bars and over coffee never go any further&#8230;
  
I&#8217;m telling myself that this note is for me, that nobody else really reads this so I can&#8217;t expect someone to learn French (or go for a run) for me &#8212; and that nobody cares if I fail, so why try failing? But if you are out there, and I haven&#8217;t made at least some progress by this time 2012, by all means call me out on it.
