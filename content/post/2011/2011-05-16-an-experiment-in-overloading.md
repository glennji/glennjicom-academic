As I was making my new week&#8217;s resolutions last night, I decided to try setting myself up for failure: making a list of non-trivial tasks and setting myself the goal of doing them every single day this week. It&#8217;s overloading, with the view that I won&#8217;t have time to _think_ (and question, and worry, and avoid) about what I&#8217;m doing &#8212; I&#8217;ll just have to _do_ it.

With that in mind, every day this week I want to:

  * write some FOSS code
  * do 20 minutes practise each of French and ("Mandarin") Chinese
  * stick 100% to the "Four Hour Body" diet outlined by Tim Ferris

&#8230; okay, so it doesn&#8217;t look like much, but these are exactly the things that keep getting squeezed out due to other things like work and the home-renovations/decorating. By listing them here (publically) as "do every day", I&#8217;m artifically increasing their importance. Check in at the end of the week to see whether I managed these three little things, and what else I forgot to do because of it!
