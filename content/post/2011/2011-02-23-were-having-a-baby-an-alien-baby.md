I think it&#8217;s about time I told the world, so if this is the first you&#8217;re hearing of it I&#8217;m sorry I couldn&#8217;t track you down beforehand!
  
Yes, it&#8217;s true: Dee and I are having a baby. Of course, she&#8217;s doing _most_ of the actual work at this point, but I&#8217;m with her (in spirit) 100%, and believe me, if I could carry the cheeky little tyke for a while, I would. Hell, we would probably alternate! Or outsource the damn thing! But unfortunately we are not Hollywood stars and thus cannot afford such luxuries &#8212; we have to do &#8220;pregnant&#8221; the old-fashioned way, with growing tum and regular tiredness and just a little morning sickness (lucky are we!).
  
So we&#8217;re in our second trimester now, with an ETA of circa 19th July, and have been for several ultrasounds (I love living in the future!) to check on the little tyke &#8230; but he or she was not cooperative on our last one, so we still don&#8217;t know the sex. Another scan next week should hopefully tell us.
  
Very bizarre being able to look _inside_ someone and count fingers, toes, heart-rate &#8230; the little human-to-be looks all freakish at this age (hence the &#8220;alien baby&#8221; sentiment), but is looking more and more human as the days go by. &#8220;I hope [she] gets your ear-lobes,&#8221; remarks Dee. &#8220;Everything else can come from me tho&#8217;.&#8221;
  
So yes, very excited we are (as Yoda might say), and looking forward to moving into our own place in two short weeks &#8212; we&#8217;ve been at Mum&#8217;s (both thereof) for almost 6 months now, which is longer than I think we spent at home _when we were growing up!_
