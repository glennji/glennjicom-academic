It has, on balance, been a rather relaxing weekend.

Of course, after yesterday&#8217;s power-outage inspired painting session, we got up early(ish) on Saturday with a list of things to do: finish the walls, cook a roast and clean up the work-site in time for dinner with Ken and Mary. A busy, tiring day but a relaxing evening knowing we&#8217;re getting close &#8212; one more coat on one wall, then white trim on french-doors and wall panelling and we&#8217;ll be ready for some floorboards. (Undecided yet: should we just get someone to install them for us?)

Today we decided to take the day off and headed along the Mornington Penisula to a little place called Flinders. We had fish and chips for lunch (and wouldn&#8217;t have given Lucy so many chips if we&#8217;d known we&#8217;d have to, quite literally, pick it up again later*), then wandered up and down the main street looking at little knick-knacks and antiques. Lucy meanwhile met a lot of people, a few dogs and managed to drag me around the park at least seventeen times.

Suitably tired (me, not her), we drove back home at about 4 o&#8217;clock. Nothing else to do this weekend but settle in with a raging fire and watch the Eurovision final. 

(Oh dear Lordi, tell me that it&#8217;s not "Jedward" from X-factor representing Ireland? Oh, it is, and they still can&#8217;t dance together; at least they&#8217;re in-tune these days, for which (I assume) we can thank technical advances in lip-sync and/or autotune. The irony is that they really should be singing Sweden&#8217;s song: "I will be popular, I will be popular" &#8212; although they would have to sing it whilst choking back tears of desperation and pints of stout, I suppose&#8230;)

* &#8230; I say "we", but it was Dee who had "bag duty" today; hey, I&#8217;ve been shovelling &#8217;em up at home. "It&#8217;s just like changing a nappy," I suggest. Dee is not impressed.

PS: Ha! Moldova is on with a hilarious circus-ska-rap song and giant Gnome hats. Nice one.
