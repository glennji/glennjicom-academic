It feels like it has been a long week this week; I suspect that all the weeks between now and Christmas will feel progressively longer, unfortunately, until we finally breach 2012 (at which point the months will fly by once again &#8212; time is relative, but perception more so). It was lovely, then, to spend a little time at home this morning, then meander casually through the day with no deadlines, task-lists or projects.
  
We checked out the Emerald fÃ©te in the morning: a church fÃ©te, with typical stalls, but a lovely collection of Triumphs out the front (and even a BSA) from the Hillriders motocycle club. Damn, I want a bike again: something classic, or at least classy, that we can throw carefully down the mountain roads. I don&#8217;t need to go fast. ðŸ™‚
  
After a compulsory sausage-inna-bun from Cut-me-own-froat Dibbler and one last, longing look at the bikes we headed to Knox. All our Christmas shopping is done now, except some stuff we&#8217;re going to make, so this was really just a pleasant drive with some commitment-frei window shopping at one end. I found some sunglasses that looked okay, but I&#8217;m really not going to spend $350 on Raybans until they can project high-definition, immersive augmented-reality directly into my eyeballs.
  
We headed home the long way, through the touristy Sassafras and Olinda. A half-hearted look for stocking-fillers for Jules at Geppetto&#8217;s Workshop saw Dee dropping and breaking about half their stock, so we hurried out and were home in time to have a play with Lucy in the backyard.
  
Now I&#8217;m about to tuck into some roast vegetables; a late dinner. All in all, an enjoyably unexciting day!
