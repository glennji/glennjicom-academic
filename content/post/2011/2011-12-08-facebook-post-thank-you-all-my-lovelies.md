From Dee on Facebook:

> Thank you all my lovelies for the birthday wishes, I feel much loved! :). I had a brilliant day, slept through the night with Jules, fab present from Glenn accompanied by mud cake for breakky, shopping then lunch at chaddy, then back home to find flowers on my door step (thanks big sis) topped off with pizza and my fav wii game DaBlob2.
