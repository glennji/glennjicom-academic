Whilst I wait for a release to build &#8212; gotta love being a programmer &#8212; I thought I best pen a quick update on the trials and tribulations of our "little" puppy Lucy, who is due to come back from a two-night stay at a specialist vets today. 

On the weekend she fell at the bottom of the stairs, and while I didn&#8217;t see it the noise was an almighty thump and she seemed a bit shocked afterwards. I gave her a hug and she ran up the stairs, but stumbled again at the top and almost fell over. It was heartbreaking! I sat her down on her bed and ran my hands over her to see if she&#8217;d actually broken anything.

Since that time she was having trouble walking, her back paw "knuckling" over and sliding on the wooden floors. When she didn&#8217;t seem to be improving, we took her to the local vet, who suggested a spine or brain injury (!!) and referred us to a Dr. Peter Laverty, who was kind enough to slip us in between his other patients.

Overnight observation showed she wasn&#8217;t improving (very quickly, anyway), so we signed the release for a [myelogram][1]. This x-ray was not without its risks, but would locate the problem and tell us whether she needed surgical intervention.

Another nervous night (her timing sucks &#8212; with Dee about to go into labour any second, we really need our rest) and morning and we get the results: it is not a compression or swelling, so it is very likely a random "spinal stroke" ([fibrocartilaginous embolism][2]) that will fully heal itself over the next 6-weeks &#8212; it could&#8217;ve been much worse! Dr. Laverty suggested that it was more likely that the fall was due to the stroke, not the other way &#8217;round. Lucy will still not be allowed downstairs for a long time yet.
