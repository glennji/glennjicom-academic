We had another ultrasound this week, a little check against heart defects (sonographer said it looked fine, but we haven&#8217;t had the final confirmation from the doctor yet &#8212; not worried). A nice little ultrasound centre in Berwick, and we found out the meaning of "4D scan" when she showed us his face in 3D &#8230; and then he moved! Opening and closing his mouth just like a real baby might (and he&#8217;s looking pretty baby-like now), it was amazing to behold. Technology is awesome! Science, you rock. They printed out a couple of 3D pics, with the digital copies on their way (can&#8217;t scan the thermal-prints) so you might&#8217;ve seen the blurry pic from Flickr:</p> 

For me, seeing him move was another "wow" moment, like hearing his heartbeat for the first time. In these pictures, he&#8217;s got his hands in front of his face so you can only kind of see half of him &#8212; but who do you think he looks like?

(The sonographer also showed us around his head &#8212; he&#8217;s already got hair! That might change who you think he looks like?)
