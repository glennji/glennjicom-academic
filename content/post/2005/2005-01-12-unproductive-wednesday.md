<div class="post-body">
  Today wasn&#8217;t an entirely productive day, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad &#8212; I did manage to burn the Yoper installation CD.<br /> My idea is as follows: Yoper is a good, young distribution, looking for contributors; Yoper doesn&#8217;t have good Gnome support yet; I&#8217;m more than a little Gnome-mad; I can program; I can help integrate Gnome into Yoper!<br /> Just need to backup my data, blow away this SUSE install, and give Garnome another go.
