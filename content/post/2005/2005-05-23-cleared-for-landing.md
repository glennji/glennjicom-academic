I have my entry clearance!!

This is a really, really good thing, and has been a point of stress for both Dee and I, as if I didn&#8217;t get my VISA then I wouldn&#8217;t be allowed on the aeroplane without a return ticket. And that&#8217;s an expensive move!

But it arrived this morning, which means my application was processed in under two weeks &#8211; very quick, from what I&#8217;ve read on the Internet. It&#8217;s an ancestry VISA which means I have up to 4 years work clearance before I need to worry about it again (by then we should be rather settled, I think).

What&#8217;s more, now that I have my passport back (it had to be sent away &#8211; talk about scary) we can put in our application for a bank account with HSBC. That&#8217;s one less thing to worry about. It&#8217;s coming up so quickly now, and I cannot wait.
