    I&#8217;ve just scheduled the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050213162057/http://www.yoper.com/">Yoper</a> ISO for download here at work &#8212; the first step in my plans for world domination (I&#8217;ll release a World Domination Manifesto on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050213162057/http://www.changethis.com/">ChangeThis</a> one of these days). When I get home tonight, I&#8217;ll back up all my critical data, and then I can kick off the installation at lunchtime tomorrow (I have to do real work too, after all).<br /> In other news, I think I love <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050213162057/http://www.autopackage.org/">Autopackage</a> &#8212; multiple front ends and multiple packaging systems, all with dependency resolution, and a nice easy &#8220;click me&#8221; kick off script for each application. That said, I&#8217;m having a devil of a time getting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050213162057/http://linux01.gwdg.de/~pbleser/rpm-navigation.php?cat=Network%2Fgaim/">version of gnutls</a> that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050213162057/http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">GAIM</a> autopackage can see and use &#8230; so maybe it&#8217;s not as good as I believe.<br /> Nah, it&#8217;s probably is just human error.
