    I just found, by accident, that I&#8217;m the second highest Google search for &#8220;chronofiles&#8221;. (The Buckminster Fuller Institute is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050213162057/http://www.bfi.org/chronofile.htm">first</a>, by the way.)<br /> **sniff** I&#8217;m so proud.<br /> Of course, a Google search for &#8220;chronofile&#8221;, singular, will not feature the glennji chronofiles at all. Please feel free to brush over this fact without pause for intelligent consideration.<br /> (If anyone is curious about the origin of the word &#8220;chronofile&#8221;, check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050213162057/http://www.bfi.org/index.html">Buckminster Fuller Institute</a>. In fact, I would recommend anyone to check out R. Buckminster Fuller&#8217;s work &#8212; whilst I found &#8220;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050213162057/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312174918/103-6665964-5148602">Critical Path</a>&#8221; somewhat of a struggle, it was an exciting (and life defining?) struggle. (His explanation to a young boy in the of wood burning as an unfolding of the solar energy in the introduction of the book was particularly engaging.)
