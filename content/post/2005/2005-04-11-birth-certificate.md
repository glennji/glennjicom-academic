Tired of waiting for an apparent &#8220;priority&#8221; copy of my grandmother&#8217;s birth certificate, today I wrote a letter to the ONS in Britain &#8230; only to return home to find the copy waiting on the coffee table. What&#8217;s more, the postmark clearly shows that it was sent only two days after I made my application, so the week in between is due to the post, not the ONS. Sorry! If I get a reply, I will apologise profusely.

I guess we get used to things happening quite quickly, be it email or text messages or such. But when things have to move through Real Space it takes time. Actually I don&#8217;t remember the last time I actually sent something through Real Space &#8211; I do my taxes online, I buy webspace and subscriptions to webapps, and I pay bills or transfer money (which is intangible in the first place). Which leaves the other Real Space atom-shifting to be either: short range (such as when we get our groceries delivered), or; &#8220;me&#8221;, via taxis or trains. And I&#8217;m acutely aware of how long it takes to shift &#8220;me&#8221; through space &#8211; how long it takes me to get to work each morning in probably my biggest gripe at the moment &#8211; so it should be rather obvious that atom-shifting anything, even some papers, around our globe is inherently a time-consuming operation.

Nevertheless I now have the certificate. The next piece of the puzzle is Dad&#8217;s certificate, so I can prove a lineage from Nana to me, like a chain of evidence in the American crime shows that saturate our public television channels here in Australia. Dad&#8217;s may prove more difficult, as it turns out, bt Dee is going to scope it ot tomorrow.

Best post before my battery goes flat, and get some sleep.&nbsp;
