We're well and truly into "savings" mode at the moment. We have a financial plan, and a budget for the trip, and we're just counting down the days until our flight. Oh, there's still more to do before then - much more - but it's close enough to be exciting. And of course, in the midst of all this penny-pinching, Dee has found herself some new shoes.



They're not exactly hiking boots - in fact, they're rather slippery (she's nearly fallen whilst sliding around on the kitcfhen tiles) - but they're still rather nice I think. She's been looking for something similar for ages now, and these came from Planet Shoes. They do some vegan products too, which is cool.

In other news, this is the first post written with my new Dvorak keyboard layout. It is naturally taking ages to write. Oh, and via the wonders of modern technology I can show you all a simulation of how our life in Scotland will shape and mould me as a man:



Should be a grand old adventure!
