Just a quick entry, since I'm at work: I have my passport!

It arrived by registered mail last weekend, and I haven't let it out of my sight yet. You really can't overestimate the psychological wellbeing that this little booklet brings - it is my pass to another world and another life. A bit melodramatic, but that's how it feels.

I couldn't wipe the grin off my face if I tried.

Now that I've got a way to get in, I just need a way to stay. My cousin Tamara has our grandmother's birth certificate, but I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to get it from her (I think it's in storage somewhere) so I might need to get another one. Which I can of course pass on to sister Dayna when she wants to come over.

I might post my passport picture when I get a chance.
