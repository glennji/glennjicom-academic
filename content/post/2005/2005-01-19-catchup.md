    I&#8217;ve been running to catch up ever since we got back from Christmas/NY holidays.<br /> It&#8217;s just been completely overwhelming &#8212; from two weeks of lazing around the campfire to two weeks of daily deadlines and impatient clients. Two weeks too much, so I called in sick today. Slept in (so good!); went to the post office to check up on my passport application; did some housework &#8212; in short, didn&#8217;t even touch the laptop until this evening.<br /> And I&#8217;m glad &#8212; it was needed. I&#8217;ve not done anything with Gnome-utils for about two million years (or so), and nor have I thought about the Opensource Meetup group or anything outside of work. Which is silly, because work isn&#8217;t even that interesting! It&#8217;s certainly not the most important thing at the moment &#8212; I want to get my participation and profile up in the opensource world in preparation for the big UK move in 5 months or so.<br /> This weekend I&#8217;m catching up with the usual suspects to discuss exactly that. It&#8217;s time to get focused once more. And for me, that means hacking on opensource projects!
