<!--StartFragment-->A relaxing stay in Vienna (Wien), with little to do and even less inclination to do it. We stayed at Wombat&#8217;s &#8220;Base&#8221; Hostel &#8212; very clean, nice, friendly and better serviced than some of the hotels we&#8217;ve stayed at. Personally I want to stay in hostels from now on, as they can be cleaner, cheaper (well, not as cheap as I&#8217;d hoped, but not bad) and much more informal; I suspect that Wombat&#8217;s is one of the nicer hostels, tho&#8217;, as others in Scotland (and even Melbourne) didn&#8217;t look half as nice.


  
So we relaxed here in the bar (1â‚¬ beer!), used the free wifi to upload some of the photos we&#8217;ve accrued and even washed some clothes, which by now were in desperate need of some soapy love. During the day we took a little walk into the city centre, but missed the tourist tram by 2 minutes and couldn&#8217;t be bothered waiting for the next &#8212; it&#8217;s a long walk into town! &#8212; so really just meandered along and eventually made it back to the hostel. It&#8217;s been quite hot and muggy here lately, so we were waiting for a big thunderstorm but it looks like it will break after we&#8217;ve left.
  
Today we&#8217;re on the Railjet train to Budapest and it&#8217;s lovely: first class, new train, two window seats and plenty of leg room. The only downside? We&#8217;re on a train filled with Poms, Kiwis and Aussies!! Who&#8217;da thunk it; sounds like they&#8217;re all on a package tour together. I&#8217;m happy in the knowledge that they&#8217;ve paid more than us \*grin\*.
