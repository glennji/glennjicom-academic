Early morning this morning, too early by far: our travel alarm (very useful thanks Dayna) exploded in an electronic tintinbulation at 6:02am precisely, shattering our slumber into little shards of activity. We showered (well, Dee showered &#8212; I had one last night instead, always be prepared. And prepared to be smelly), dressed and rushed down for a quick hotel breakfast by 6:30am (eggs, toast, apple juice and, why not, a spicy lasagne!). By 7am we were in the foyer, and soon enough a minivan arrived to take us on the second-ever &#8220;organised tour&#8221; we&#8217;ve ever been on.
  
The bus took us on a short tour of the hotels and hostels in Bangkok, picking up people, dropping them off and at one point just driving around the block a couple of times &#8212; looking for a carpark, maybe? We were issued little coloured stickers, ticked off a list, and eventually were on our way our of the city and towards the infamous River Kwai. It was a couple of hours, and the bus driver was crazy: there are two lanes painted on most roads, but in practise it&#8217;s three, with the &#8220;center lane&#8221; (drive along the line) for rushed overtaking and swerving around slower traffic. Yeah, glad we&#8217;re not driving ourselves.
  
River Kwai (and the requisite cemetary/monument to the commonwealth P.O.W.s who died building the bridge) was unfortunately a bit boring, but brief; our next trip took us into the hills to ride elephants! We both felt bad putting our feet on his back (and I thought we were about to fall off any second) but we walked around and took photos and even &#8220;shook hands&#8221; (er, trunks? Trunks and hands?). When the ride was over we had no problem tipping the driver (really the elephant) and buying a round of delicious bananas for the pachyderms. They eat right out of your hands!
  
From here, a tuk-tuk took (heh) us to a spot on a nearby river &#8212; I don&#8217;t know which one &#8212; and we ate Thai food on a little floating bamboo pontoon; we tucked in with relish (excitement, not actual relish) as, after all, breakfast was many hours earlier. Sated, comfortably full, we donned life-jackets and were towed upstream by a long-boat, then floated quietly back down to our dock. It would&#8217;ve been more relaxing, maybe, if we hadn&#8217;t floated past a &#8220;karaoke pontoon&#8221;. Or if the patrons had had better voices, I suppose.
  
A new minubus took us to some waterfalls and a picnic area, literally swarming with Thai kids and their families. It was a nice place for a day out, I guess, but we only had twenty minutes (and no swimmers) so wandered for a while then grabbed some barbeque chicken sticks (we always call them &#8220;goat sticks&#8221;, in memory of a Nepalese restaurant we visited in Richmond many moons ago &#8212; the nickname is both easier to remember/pronounce than the Nepalese, and satisfyingly juvenile if you say it fast). Back on the bus!
  
The final stop was the highlight &#8212; although the elephants were pretty amazing &#8212; as we saw, sat, patted and walked with tigers in the &#8220;Tiger Temple&#8221;. The photos tell the story better than I can.
  
Now we&#8217;re back on a (totally new) bus, headed back to Bangkok. Tomorrow we&#8217;re planning on hitting the shopping malls, then finding a new/better hotel for our final night in town &#8212; on Tuesday we&#8217;re taking a train, then a ferry, to the island of Koh Samui. Once there we&#8217;ve got eight nights at a little resort-type place &#8212; perfect to unwind and spend the rest of our 15-day Thai VISA. Fingers are well and truly crossed that, unlike the White Orchid, the resort lives up to the pretty little photos of the place.
