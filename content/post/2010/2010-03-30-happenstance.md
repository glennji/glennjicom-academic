It looks like we might have our cargo ship back after all &#8212; Hamish emailed this morning to say he could get us on the MSC Basel on the 31st July, Singapore to Melbourne. Yes, that&#8217;s the same ship he originally had us on, so we&#8217;ve either bumped the other passengers OR will be travelling with them! (In a separate room, I hope.)
  
It got me thinking about chance and <a title="Wikitionary link to the word &quot;happenstance&quot;" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/happenstance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">happenstance</a> (a great word, by the way, but one that Chrome doesn&#8217;t know how to spell) , and how <a title="Why 'The Universe Is Perfectly Set Up For Life' Is a Terrible Justification for God's Existence" href="http://www.alternet.org/belief/146165/why_'the_universe_is_perfectly_set_up_for_life'_is_a_terrible_justification_for_god's_existence?page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everything that ever happens is all equally &#8212; and massively &#8212; unlikely</a>.  (It&#8217;s funny that I should stumble across that particular article while thinking about such things, huh? I mean, what are the chances? :-))
  
So yeah, things seem to be unfolding as they should &#8212; but is that actually _meaningful_, or just a creation/product of our self-aware minds? I tend to think both: &#8216;meaning&#8217; is only meaningful to a sentient creature, after all, but that fact doesn&#8217;t in any way lessen the, er, significance _(meaning)_ of it all.  I guess the point is: we&#8217;ve got a second unlikely opportunity to get home without flying and we&#8217;re taking it!
