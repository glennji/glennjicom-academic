So you&#8217;ve probably noticed it&#8217;s been rather quiet from us of late, and you may have guessed why: the lovely Chinese government decided to block this website with their beloved Great Firewall. They also blocked Facebook, Blogger, Flickr and a whole bunch of other sites at random.
  
But we&#8217;re in Laos now, so I can post what we got up to in China and upload a stack of photos from the nearest wifi-enabled pub (this Internet cafe is expensive). See you soon!
