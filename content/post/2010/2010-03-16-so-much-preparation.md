Well I think I&#8217;ve found all the WordPress plugins we might possibly need now, and so after a weekend and a day this travel journal is about ready to be used in anger (as they say &#8211; although who &#8220;they&#8221; are and why they say that I have no idea). Maps, twitter, spam-filters and the theme &#8211; all in place and ready for us to hit the road, er, _tracks_.
  
Which is not to say that _we_ are ready to hit the tracks, not by a long shot. Thanks to Dee&#8217;s hard work on the weekend, we have a good idea of times and trains for the &#8220;Orient Express&#8221; leg, all the way from London to Moscow; the &#8220;Asia&#8221; leg is somewhat more &#8230; flexible. Not just because it&#8217;s my task and I was too busy mucking about with a website, but also because (from what we read) you can&#8217;t buy China train tickets more than 10 days in advance, unless you want to pay a premium (sometimes double) to a Chinese travel agency. Which we don&#8217;t, have you SEEN the exchange rate for the pound at the moment?!
  
Working out where we go in China is the next step, obviously, and while I&#8217;m doing that Dee is comparing the prices of individual tickets versus a Eurail pass. Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia is mostly a set route, copied from every package tour ever run (Ha noi, Hue, Ho Chi Minh City &#8230; Vietnam is a thin little slice of countryside, so there&#8217;s not really any other way to go), while we still need to confirm the flight/ship back to Australia &#8212; Dee just got a response from the freighter people who said the ship is all booked out for the rest of the year. She also said that everyone online seems to know a guy named Hamish who organises this kind of thing&#8230;
  
We also need to finalise shipping our stuff back down-under. The idea is to get a container, or part there-of, and fill it with those few items we own (and Dayna&#8217;s Wii if we can pack it before she notices ;-)). By the time we get home, then, it&#8217;s waiting for us somewhere &#8211; mostly probably at Mum&#8217;s (Ann) or at Mum&#8217;s (Tricia), but we should probably get the okay from them before a bunch of boxes show up on their doorstep I guess. The packing/shipping gives me a chance to write a little home inventory web-app, since all the open source ones seem to be lacking in some way. It&#8217;s mostly working now (for a single user with access to the database), but I&#8217;ll polish it up and drop it on SourceForge before we go.
  
Meanwhile, it was an early start this morning, with a 5am incident call for Dee (ongoing). We will not be missing these, that&#8217;s for sure.
