Admittedly it&#8217;s not _quite_ barbeque weather yet &#8211; a &#8220;fresh&#8221; 9°C currently , but when Dee found a local hardware store with coals in stock how could we argue? (The coal/rocks were not on display, of course: &#8220;We don&#8217;t really put them out because nobody is having barbecues just now.&#8221; &#8220;Perhaps not, but I&#8217;m Aussie.&#8221;)  So I&#8217;m sitting on the balcony near a raging fire, sipping a beer and watching an England vs. Scotland rugby match on the telly through the window. Occasionally the other spectators &#8211; a Scot and a kiwi &#8211; explode in cheers, while Dee looks on in studied confusion.
  
In the morning we headed to Angel Islington, to find the realrussia.co.uk offices. A bit weird &#8212; they do the VISA applications over here, but the rest of it seems to be run by the head office in Moscow, and as a result if you need to buy tickets the staff in London can&#8217;t really do much more than point you at the website. Fair enough, but weird nonetheless: after speaking to a woman there we decided to come back home and use our own broadband instead. Via an antiques market, of course &#8212; Dee loves her antique markets.
  
A delicious Turkish lunch on Upper Street, then back home for an afternoon of train timetables and spreadsheets. But we&#8217;re getting there!
  
We&#8217;ve spent much of the day figuring out our &#8220;long way home&#8221; trip, starting with the departure time that Natasha from realrussia.co.uk has given us and working backwards. It looks like we&#8217;ve got the dates and most of the trains sorted out now, thanks to Dee; for my part I&#8217;ve updated this website to be a bit more travel-friendly, with a new WordPress installation and various plugins for Flickr, Youtube and Maps. Our dining table is littered with maps, guidebooks and papers as we bounce ideas and research off each other.
