Our second full day in Paris and it hasn&#8217;t quite sunk in yet &#8212; we&#8217;re not coming back (well, for a while anyway).
  
Yesterday we oriented ourselves, spending the day walking around le quartier latin and rediscovering the places we visited the first time &#8217;round &#8212; almost five years ago to the day. Our under-used legs complaining, we ate a pleasant picnic then watched a movie at l&#8217;Odean cinema before heading back to the hotel to book dinner at Nos Ancestres Les Gaulois (Our Ancestors the Gauls).
  
A feast! This caveau-style restaurant on l&#8217;Ile Saint Louie serves a veritable Gaulish banquet in a traditional style: an enormous basket of raw vegetables; wine by the jug (help yourself from the barrel); a buffet of mixed salade; salami and cured meats with an enormous knife for slicing. (Just remember the feasts at the end of an Asterix and Obelix comic at you&#8217;ll have a good idea &#8212; although our musician was a lot better than poor ol&#8217; Cacophonix.) And that&#8217;s just to start!
  
We were basically full when the main course arrived &#8212; flame-cooked meat served on lettuce with an enormous baked potato. At this point a white-haired, guitar-toting musician arrived; for the next hour we clapped and danced and laughed at his antics.
  
After mains came cheese, and &#8216;though our bulging bellies protested we HAD to taste the various soft cheeses (like Camenbert, but lots of different flavours), all served on a heavy wooden chopping board with a sharp, simple knife. It hardly looked like we&#8217;d touched it at all when the friendly staff replaced it with the next and final course: a giant basket of fresh fruit. I sliced up a kiwi-fruit, but left the bananas, peaches, apples and other fruits alone. A highly recommended experience &#8212; they even have vegetarian options for the meat-shy.
  
Today we&#8217;ve organised ourselves, as tomorrow morning we&#8217;re on the fast train to Strasbourg. I think that is the key &#8212; we&#8217;re not going to get to another city and wonder how to get to our hotel or hostel!!
