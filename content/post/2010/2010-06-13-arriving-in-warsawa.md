<!--StartFragment-->Did a lot of writing on the train from Krakow to Warsawa, so as soon as we get Internet there&#8217;ll be a mass update. We sat in our first class cabin and relaxed with free coffee, juice, water and little ginger biscuits. It&#8217;s a short trip here, maybe three hours, but we left ourselves plenty of time &#8220;just in case&#8221;.


  
Lucky, too: we jumped off at Warsaw Centrum, walked up the platform a little and accosted a stranger: was this station the same as &#8220;Warsaw Ws&#8221;? No, he told us, that is Warsaw West &#8212; which is where our Moscow train leaves from. Panicked, we rushed back to Wagon 4 and jumped back on our train just before it pulled out&#8230;
  
&#8220;Ooh look honey,&#8221; exclaimed Dee a little later, &#8220;There are peasants on the track!&#8221;
  
What? You can&#8217;t call go around calling people that &#8212; it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re royalty or something. &#8220;Oh, I mean pheasants,&#8221; she continued cheerfully, &#8220;There are PHEASANTS on the track.&#8221; I laugh and laugh. (I&#8217;m still laughing now, just thinking about it.)
  
Warsaw is an industrial city, as Magda (Magduisha) warned us &#8212; not much in the way of sights, not near the train station anyway. We wander out and across the (massive) road for a &#8220;stodgy&#8221; lunch of chicken, mushroom and Polish dumplings. The girl behind the bar &#8212; and it is a bar rather than a restaurant or cafe, we now see, but it&#8217;s also the only thing open and backpackers can&#8217;t be choosers &#8212; doesn&#8217;t speak angielski but we get out point across with a whole lot of pointing and hand waving. Two hours &#8217;til our train to Moscow.
  
It&#8217;s a little bit scary now: headed out of Europe and into the complete unknown for the first time.<!--EndFragment-->
