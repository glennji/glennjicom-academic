Time is flying: we have only two weeks to go, and one of those weeks we will be sleeping on Andy&#8217;s couch. Both Dee and I have confessed to being shocked by it this week, as it feels like we should have another month or so, but no. On Friday a man in a van comes to take our (meagre) belongings away and pack them in a container-ship bound for Australia; the following Monday we hand over the keys to this apartment and move ourselves downstairs to Andy&#8217;s, with nothing more than our packs, our wits and an arguably-naive optimism about the future.
  
Oh, and one more week at work.
  
Today we headed to Holborn for high-tea. Well, something like that: it was actually high _tease_ at a burlesque club called &#8220;Volupte&#8221;. An indiscriminate building tucked behind the Holborn Viaduct, Volupte&#8217;s tame exterior (and a set of thick velvet curtains) hides a fun and funky underground lounge, ill-lit with spotlights of purple, pink and blue-green. As your eyes adjust from the afternoon&#8217;s glare to the dim interior light, you see a number of closely packed tables set for two, candlelight twinkling merrily off glass and silverware on each. A few nervous couples are already seated, enjoying the complimentary champagne and wondering what an afternoon of &#8220;burlesque&#8221; might hold. A small clearing around a microphone designates the stage; at the back, larger tables for birthdays and hen&#8217;s nights are already crowded with giggling young women in 1940&#8217;s attire.
  
Billed as &#8220;Afternoon Tease&#8221;, our show at Volupte included sandwiches (no crusts, thank-you), scones with jam and cream, _petit fours_ and (of course) tea. Such a strange and delightful environment! To be sitting in a Parisian-styled _caveau_ enjoying that most British of past-times, afternoon tea!
  
And the shows! We started with &#8220;Rajesh the Bollywood Lounge Singer&#8221;, an Indian man with a remarkable moustache. He sang, he danced (and danced!!), he told risque jokes &#8212; all very har-de-har-har, and very much fun &#8212; Dee inadvertently laughed out loud at one joke, thanks largely to her familiarity with Indian mannerisms and culture (from work), and he gave her a nod of appreciation, &#8220;Thank-you, yes.&#8221;
  
Over the next few hours we saw a &#8220;Gateaux Vivant&#8221;, the elephant man (er, woman) and a young lady in horn-rimmed spectacles who just _really_ wanted to sell more ice-creams. Only a little bit naughty &#8212; it probably caused shock and outrage amongst the more respectable folk back in the forties, but these days you see more skin on an episode of Home And Away &#8212; but with a strong sense of humour and showmanship (showwomanship?), and very much fun.
  
We walked home, hoping to work off some of the delicious scones&#8230;
