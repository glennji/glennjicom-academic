**Update**: I didn&#8217;t find time (or inspiration?) to finish writing about our adventures in Budapest, but I did manage to upload [some of the better photos][1] to Flickr. In the meantime, we&#8217;re away again!
  
One more day in Budapest, then it was time to board the Eurocity Night train to Krakow. The morning was spent organising and repacking &#8212; it is truly astounding how messy things can get if you don&#8217;t keep adjusting &#8212; and so the sun was well and truly above us when we finally checked out. I must say, the Maverick Hostel in Budapest was an awesome place to stay &#8212; cool, funky, cheap, clean &#8230; and the guy running the place was exceedingly nice! We handed the keys back with a promise to be back for our packs at around 6pm, then headed out to meet Andy.
  
Another hot day! We stayed close to our accommodation, as Andy had a 2pm taxi to the airport and it was too hot to go traipsing around again: we realised that with the night train, and then (hopefully) an all-day tour in Oswiecim (Auschwitz) it would be quite some time before we got a proper shower, so were determined not to get too sweaty. A couple of drinks (including the sweetest juice/syrup drink imaginable) at &#8220;Bonnie & Clydes&#8221; and it was time to say our second goodbyes to the White Bear. See you &#8217;round World Cup time, Andy!!
  
While at the cafe we sorted out a rough &#8220;crib sheet&#8221; for Beijing, thanks to ubiquitous free wifi all over Budapest. Seriously London, your entire economy is information-based, how can Budapest be better at this than the capital of the British Empire?? Also used the opportunity to draft the next part of our &#8220;stay cool&#8221; plan &#8212; find a movie cinema.
  
(This almost didn&#8217;t work: by the time we&#8217;d walked to the cinema we were both hot and bothered. Watched &#8220;Robin Hood&#8221;, which was better than expected &#8212; and they were low expectations indeed &#8212; and tried Hungarian snack food in the form of chocolate-coated cream cheese. It&#8217;s not as bad as it sounds!)
  
After that it was a bus back to Budapest Keleti Paladyvar and dinner at a station restaurant before boarding our train. A little scary &#8212; we asked a official-looking man where our carriage was, and he took all our tickets away! Turns out that&#8217;s normal (on the Trans-Siberian they may even hold our passports, eek) and he was our carriage manager, but we spent a few nervous minutes waiting for the ticket collector to eject us from our cabin.
  
Hot in the city; hotter still inside the little dual-bunk cabin. We had the windows open, but it wasn&#8217;t &#8217;til we started moving that there was anything like airflow; a full night of travelling north (with the window open the whole time) has cooled our room immensely, to the point that I begin to wonder if I should actually get some trousers out of my pack. Outside, green fields and forests race by; every ten or twenty minutes we slow down to pass through a cute Polish village, then ramp up to speed again, shaking and rattling. Clackety-clack!<!--EndFragment-->
