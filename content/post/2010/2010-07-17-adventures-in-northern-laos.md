Relaxing at Le Leela Hotel in Vientiane, Laos, and it&#8217;s time for a long overdue update. Wifi here is fast! Probably because we&#8217;re the only guests.
  
We&#8217;ve had a bit of an adventure in Laos so far, largely due to &#8220;travellers&#8217; belly&#8221; that hit us in Jinghong, near the border on the Chinese side. I think it started in Chengdu, however: one of the staff there was sneezing and coughing, and shortly after rolling out of town I did the same. (It was NOT bird &#8216;flu, as I may have suggested &#8212; or if it was, I recovered remarkably!)
  
The trip from China to Laos was a long, bumpy day with a whole lot of unnecessary stops &#8212; it became apparent early on that the whole purpose of the bus was to transport Chinese goods (tax-free?) into Laos, with humans as a secondary consideration at best. We sat on hard seats crammed between carrots and cabbages, sacks of potatoes and soggy-cardboard boxes filled with I-don&#8217;t-even-wanna-know, flying &#8217;round corners and over dirt roads. There were a couple of breaks, of course: the passengers duly disembarked, clambering over the drygoods to disappear for a squat or pee into the trees at the side of the road.
  
After getting through border control,  over the border, and mostly over the head-cold, we stayed at a small Laos village called [Luang Nam Tha][1] &#8212; &#8220;area near Nam Tha (river)&#8221;. We had two nights here, and didn&#8217;t really do a lot &#8212; just spent the time recuperating from the first hit of &#8220;travellers&#8217; belly&#8221; either of us had experienced. Something about the water, perhaps?
  
We checked into the biggest, most fancy-looking hotel we could find, the Royal. Showered, shaved, cleaned and relaxed, we headed out for dinner. There&#8217;s not much to see in LNT, but the food at Panda Restaurant was good. We filled our boots and retired for an early night &#8212; I couldn&#8217;t even finish half of the bottle of Beerlao that we were to find ubiquitous throughout the countryside.
  
From Nam Tha we took a short 5 hour bus to Oudomxay, a little town with not a whole lot going for it, but halfway between Luang Nam Tha and Luang Prabang. Our one night there was spent at a karaoke bar down the road (our guest house was plain, but right near the bus station).
  
Once we got to Luang Prabang we were old pros: negotiating with the tuk-tuk drivers, pointing out our chosen guest house on the (often wrong) Lonely Planet map, even attempting to pronounce the streets and temples nearby. Tuk-tuks are ubiquitous here, even more so than the infamous &#8220;Beerlao&#8221; beer, and for a small fee (we were happy to overpay at £4 for a few dusty miles) they&#8217;ll take you right to your door. In our case, it was the Lane Xang Villa, directly across from a &#8220;Wat&#8221;: we watched young monks in orange robes play football in the rain; wandered around wooden buildings, elaboratively carved; and looked at ancient stone stupas and archways.
  
All in all a relaxing time, although the nights were sometimes too hot to sleep!
