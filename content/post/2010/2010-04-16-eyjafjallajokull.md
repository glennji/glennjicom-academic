    It seems the Norse god <strong><a title="Wikipedia article" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eyjafjallajokull</a></strong> has brought the British aeronautical travel industry to its knees this weekend, erupting from deep within his glacial palace and spreading ashy vengeance upon the mortals who dare chase through the skies in chariots of aluminium, steel and beige plastic.<br /> Anyway, I hope this doesn&#8217;t disrupt Dayna and Bruce when they fly back into London in the wee-hours of Monday morning!
