With work moving along (well, slowly), we decided to take a weekend break in the middle of the week and spend two nights in Albury, over the NSW border. We headed off nice and early, stopping at Deniliquin (the home of the annual &#8220;Ute Muster&#8221;) for a picnic lunch.
  
A little further down the track and we found the house I grew up in &#8212; for a couple of years, anyway. (Long enough ago that I couldn&#8217;t remember it even a little; big sister Dayna could &#8216;though!)
  
A couple hours on and we&#8217;re in Albury. We found a little self-contained cottage, with a room for Dee&#8217;s mum and one for us, a &#8220;faux&#8221; log fire and a little verandah to sit on and watch the sunrise. All very relaxing indeed! Dee cooked us a nice meal, and we all sat and watched a little crappy Aussie television&#8230;
  
Today we checked out the shopping in Albury &#8212; Dee trying on more engagement rings, I think she&#8217;s trying to tell me something &#8212; before we headed out to the oh-so-touristy Ettamogah Pub for lunch, a couple of beers and a quick play on the pokies. Oh yeah, livin&#8217; the dream mate.
