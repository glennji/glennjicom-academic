We &#8220;Northerners&#8221; (well, temporary) had a sunny, if cold, day today, the first in weeks if not months. Perfect weather, in fact, for an [early morning walk &#8217;round Regent&#8217;s Park][1], so I was up and out the door shortly after breakfast. I must admit, I felt bad for the birds swimming in the near-frozen lake but they didn&#8217;t seem to mind.
  
Dee and I have put together a list of 101 things to do in London before we leave, and so yesterday (Saturday) we had a [&#8220;Sherlock Holmes&#8221;-themed day out][2]. We tubed to Baker Street from London Bridge, then walked along the street until we found number 221b &#8211; Sherlock&#8217;s address, although apparently when (Sir) Arthur Conan Doyle wrote the mystery stories Baker Street only went up to 100! These days it is a tiny museum (and gift shop) to the fictional detective; I even had a chance to sit with Dr. Watson himself!
  
Afterwards we headed to an &#8220;indy&#8221; cinema on Baker Street for the new Sherlock Holmes movie (starring the inimitable Robert Downey Jr., who I&#8217;m quite sure I saw shopping in a little specialist food market in North London last year). Not the greatest cinema, as it turned out, but appropriately located nevertheless &#8211; and they served wine and popcorn, so by the time the movie was over I was feeling rather jolly indeed. We stopped briefly at The Globe &#8211; the pub rather than the Shakespearean theatre, because I&#8217;ve been past it a bunch of times but never entered &#8211; before walking through Soho to meet Dayna and Bruce for dinner at Wagamama.
  
After some so-so Japanese food (not bad, but not something to write home about &#8211; oh, sorry, guess I shouldn&#8217;t have mentioned it then) we went searching for London&#8217;s last and only street lamp that is powered by burning sewer gas. We eventually found the &#8220;poppy lamp&#8221; in a little laneway off The Strand, and were disappointed to find that it had been converted to electricity after a hapless motorist knocked the original over with his car!
  
So disappointed by this were we that we had to retire to the local &#8220;Coal House&#8221; for commiserations over a glass of bubbly. Our spirit suitably lightened, we walked along The Strand, over Waterloo Bridge, and towards home.
  
We are very much looking forward to seeing you all again soon!
