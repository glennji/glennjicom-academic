_A late post (on a train to Warsaw) about the rest of our time in Budapest &#8212; what, you were expecting something as mundane as linearity? Seriously, from me? Okay, I&#8217;ll back-date it so it appears in the right place in the timeline, eh, that should just about do it._
  
On our second day in Budapest, and on Dayna&#8217;s sage advice, we bought tickets for the big red &#8220;hop on, hop off&#8221; tour bus. It was 12:30 and too hot to be walking about by the time we boarded, and so we did a full circuit &#8212; through Pest, along Andrassy Utca to the Heroes Square, then back and across the river to the &#8220;old town&#8221; of Buda and our first glimpse of that half of the city. An icecream at the Citadella gave us the opportunity for some amazing panoramic views from the hill (I&#8217;ve taken photos and will attempt to stitch them together with some software). It also gave us a chance to plan what we would do on Thursday &#8212; the palace, Fisherman&#8217;s Bastion, Citadella and the medieval township itself.
  
The interesting bit actually started when we went looking for a late snack, although we didn&#8217;t realise it at the time. Wandering around Pest we found a place called the &#8220;SMS Cafe&#8221; &#8212; innocent enough from the outside, with a cool looking dragon logo and cheap Hungarian beer (yes, sensing a theme?). But once inside we noticed little details: the heavy black drapes, impressive bar, skeletons on the door to the toilet, the other customers &#8230; this was a gothic night-club! Tamed by the day, sure, just a cool, dark place for the Creatures of the Night to have a coffee and smoke skinny foreign cigarettes &#8212; but in our backpacker costume of cargo shorts, sweaty t-shirts and floppy hats, we couldn&#8217;t have looked more out of place. No wonder our smiling, well-pierced bar-tender was grinning as she served us Dreher and mineral water &#8230; she was hoping we&#8217;d stay &#8217;til dusk turned to night, and the feasting would begin!
  
(Actually, she WAS really nice, just like almost everyone we met in Budapest. In fact, the only mean person was a disgruntled, middle-aged ticket woman on the tour bus who wanted us to know our 24 hour tickets had expired &#8212; they were valid from purchase time (10:30am) not time of first boarding (12:30am)!! Which we actually asked about when we bought the tickets &#8212; &#8220;all day tomorrow is fine&#8221; &#8212; but as she let us board anyway we let it slide.)
  
After a little more wandering, dinner at a (fairly non-descript) restaurant. We joked about the goth place &#8212; I&#8217;d wanted to go to a Goth club in London with Dayna sometime, fully &#8220;cyberdogged&#8221; &#8212; and suggested that when Andy visits Australia (on his way to, or from, New Zealand for the world cup) we should all go &#8220;goth/emo/cyber&#8221; in a club in Sydney. &#8220;Yeah, me as a Goth,&#8221; quipped Andy sarcastically, &#8220;I can really see it.&#8221;
  
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, man,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Pale skin, white hair &#8212; dress you all in black and I think you&#8217;ll look awesome!&#8221;
  
&#8220;Or all in white,&#8221; Dee suggested. &#8220;You could be a kind of anti-Goth.&#8221;
  
&#8220;They&#8217;ll probably make you their king,&#8221; I mused.
  
&#8220;Beating the ladies off with a stick,&#8221; added Dee.
  
&#8220;Not sure you want THOSE kinds of girls &#8230; or maybe you do?&#8221; And so on; the teasing was remorseless, but Andy gives as good as he gets and we were all laughing as we walked along the streets in search of a local bar like that we&#8217;d discovered yesterday.
  
Which is probably why, when we saw Cafe M, we didn&#8217;t notice some of the telling signs that we should have. We went in and the over-enthusiastic bartender had us come sit at the bar &#8212; despite the rest of the (admittedly tiny) place being quite empty. He chatted non-stop, played a weird mix of classical opera and too-loud pop-electronica and generally just fussed about behind the little bar. &#8220;You want to see some video?&#8221; he asked, and we turned around to the wall-mounted flat-screen in time to see the full name of the bar &#8212; &#8220;Cafe Mystery &#8211; Gay Bar&#8221;, in rainbow-coloured letters &#8212; disappear and be replaced with a movie where half-naked football players covered themselves with balls. &#8220;You want leaflets?&#8221; he continued, distributing the local gay magazine to us and two Americans who had just arrived.
  
So we finished our drinks with some amusement, and decided to go somewhere a little less &#8220;hetrophobic&#8221; (just kidding!). The music was too loud to really explain, &#8220;Oh, we didn&#8217;t know it was a gay bar. Oops,&#8221; or get into conversation with the American couple, so we smiled and waved goodbye instead (&#8220;Do you think we scared them away?&#8221; asked one of the men). Both Dee and I have been in gay bars before &#8212; she used to frequent one in Brisbane when she lived there, and I&#8217;ve even been chatted up in Manchester &#8212; but Andy hadn&#8217;t so it was time for more teasing.
  
For our second, and final, drink we tried to be a bit more careful, and picked a place where a tourist family sat with their kids on a table out front. More teasing: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, look &#8212; there&#8217;s two men there, two women sitting there, it might be a gay bar too! Our waiter is slim, with very well-groomed hair!&#8221; We sat and laughed and tried a fruit cocktail, then just sat back and watched the world go by for a while. &#8220;Seriously,&#8221; whispered Dee when Andy was away to the toilet for a moment, &#8220;This actually might be an &#8216;alternative lifestyle&#8217; type bar. Don&#8217;t tell Andy, okay?&#8221;
  
I headed in to use the same facilities, and on my way back out passed a large man in drag, with curly blonde wig and immaculate makeup. I grinned &#8212; the more diverse the culture, the better as far as I&#8217;m concerned &#8212; and was about to tell the others when a stretch limo arrived and five young transvestites sashayed inside, negating the need altogether. &#8220;Must be a show on!&#8221; exclaimed Dee, but we agreed we were all just too tired to try to get tickets. &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s hope Bangkok is safe by the time we get to Thailand,&#8221; Dee relented. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to see the Lady Boys show.&#8221;
  
With that glamorous end to our evening, and a good story to tell here on the journal (and, for Andy, on the next football trip), we headed off to our respective hostels/hotels and promptly fell asleep, the theme from &#8220;Priscilla&#8221; playing in our minds&#8230;<!--EndFragment-->
