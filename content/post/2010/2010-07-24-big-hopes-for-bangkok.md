We arrived in Bangkok with big hopes: our hotel, The White Orchid, looked great in the photos, with a jacuzzi, spa and massage room and a roof-top restaurant overlooking the city from the 12th floor. We were tired, smelly (nowhere to wash on an overnight train) and ready to just melt into a pampered, self-indulgent lifestyle for a couple of days. But as the quote goes, &#8220;the best laid plans of mice and men oft go astray.&#8221; For us, the &#8220;straying&#8221; began with the room &#8212; upgraded, but still plain, old and under-maintained &#8212; and continued as we explored the hotel, ignoring &#8220;keep out&#8221; and &#8220;staff only&#8221; signs as, well, there were no staff-members above the second floor.
  
We were disappointed by the roof-top restaurant &#8212; empty, derelict, nice-enough views but nobody up there &#8212; but utterly dismayed to find the spa-room (jacuzzi!!) closed, locked and unlit from within. Why advertise this? (Answer: it gets people through the door.) Why have directions to each service prominently displayed in elevators and on signage throughout the hotel? (Answer: cheaper than taking them down.) Frustrating more than annoying, but also annoying enough that we would never recommend anyone stay there; for our final night in Bangkok, as we only booked three and want to stay a fourth, we&#8217;re looking elsewhere &#8230; and inspecting rooms before we agree to anything.
  
To escape our dismal hotel, we took a river- and canal-cruise. A tuk-tuk journey &#8212; and they are different here to Laos &#8212; down to the water, then a couple of hours sailing in a little boat (a &#8220;putt-putt&#8221;, maybe?) with a smiling but quiet &#8220;driver&#8221;. We sat and relaxed, enjoying the gentle swell and a beer bought from a canoe that pulled up next to us (on the floating-vendor&#8217;s insistence, we bought a beer for our &#8220;driver&#8221; (captain?) too, &#8216;though I didn&#8217;t see if she drank it while navigating the narrow canals or not). We saw the Grand Palace, the Thai Naval college, a couple of enormous lizards swimming through the water and about four hundred Wats, Buddhist monasteries replete with temples, stupas and enormous gold statues. We chose NOT to stop at the &#8220;Snake Park&#8221; because, frankly, &#8220;&#8230;dar[ing] to handle poisonous snakes&#8230;&#8221; is not our idea of fun &#8212; and we can do that in Australia just by setting up camp.
  
Cruise over and the afternoon well-and-truly underway, we headed for a little cafe for a bite to eat and something cool to drink, avoiding (and after a short while, ignoring) the touts offering cheap suits, cheap silks, cheap jewellery, cheap crap &#8212; and of course the ubiquitous and insistent tuk-tuk drivers, &#8220;30 baht, where you wanna go sir? Hello sir.&#8221; Screw it: doesn&#8217;t look that far to the &#8220;O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s Irish Bar&#8221;, let&#8217;s walk!
  
It turned out further than expected, but perhaps if we hadn&#8217;t stopped at little shopping malls along the way &#8230; anyway, we found another British pub instead, the Duke of Wellington, and ducked in &#8212; it was positively icy, in stark contrast to the muggy heat outdoors &#8212; for some dinner and a little Rugby: Wallabies vs Springboks at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. (When Australia won, outclassing the &#8220;Saffas&#8221; with ease, we quickly scanned the room for the stricken faces of South Africans, planning to remorselessly tease and ridicule them, but if any were present they demonstrated a stoic composure worthy of a Hollywood botox-beauty &#8212; not a single tear in the place. Oh well, there&#8217;s always next time&#8230;)
