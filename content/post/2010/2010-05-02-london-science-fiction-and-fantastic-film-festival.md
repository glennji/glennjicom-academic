It&#8217;s been a week of sci-fi for me this week: the Sci-fi London Film Festival.
  
Our good friend Anthony is visiting, and I caught up with him on Monday night down by the river. We sat outside and just chatted for a couple of hours &#8212; good, geeky stuff like the future of software development, or human-capability assessment and enhancement. So great catching up with him!
  
On Wednesday we kicked off the film festival with a preview screening of Vincenzi Natali&#8217;s &#8220;Splice&#8221;. It&#8217;s a great movie, and the highlight of the festival for me: exactly the right balance of &#8220;disturbing&#8221; and &#8220;plausible&#8221;, and with a personality that is missing from most &#8220;creature&#8221; films. Oh, and the most comfortable seats I&#8217;ve ever experienced in a cinema (at Apollo, Piccadilly). Anthony even won a DVD!
  
Thursday I took Dee to another Natali film, a black-comedy called &#8220;Nothing&#8221;. It opens with the statement, &#8220;The events portrayed in this film are true. Really true. 100% true. Promise.&#8221; and quickly turns hilariously ridiculous. A good night, although I wish Dee had come along to Splice as well.
  
The next night was the comedy event &#8220;Geeks Night Out&#8221;. Some funny comedians, although one or two of them played up the self-defensive &#8220;I live in my Mum&#8217;s basement,&#8221; angle and I wanted to shake them: you don&#8217;t need to put yourself down for liking comics! Not here! Not now! You are amongst friends!
  
Saturday was a day off sci-fi, although I could happily have watched more. I dropped Ant off at the station then walked the long way home, har-har. Even stopped for Pimms on the south bank! A beautiful, sunny day.
  
Today we watched the strangest of all the films, an adaption of Stanislaw Lem&#8217;s &#8220;One Human Minute&#8221; called &#8220;One&#8221;. Mind-bendingly lovely. We walked home from that one, too, and stopped at the appropriately named Mad Hatter pub for a drink before heading out to Del A&#8217;ziz for dinner with Dayna and Bruce (now they&#8217;re back &#8212; with all the films I&#8217;ve hardly seen them!!).
  
One more film tomorrow: Vampires, a documentary about a family of our favourite blood-suckers living in Belgium.
  
(Edit: back-posting again. Perhaps when we&#8217;re travelling I&#8217;ll have more time to write these damn things?)
