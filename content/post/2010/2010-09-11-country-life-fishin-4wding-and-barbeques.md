Ah, country living. For the last month we&#8217;ve been spending time with family in regional Victoria, with only a couple of quick day-trips into &#8220;the city&#8221; (Melbourne) so far. It is relaxing, certainly: we&#8217;ve had a couple of barbeques, even fired up the chiminea (a kind of cast-iron wood-fire oven); we spent an hour fishing on the Murray (and now want fishing-licenses of our own); even did a little &#8220;off-roading&#8221; down some bush tracks, although we balked at attempted a water-crossing, thanks to the recent flooding rains. If we couldn&#8217;t keep two wheels on the dry, we weren&#8217;t risking it.
  
That was of course the first item on the long list of things we have to do to establish ourselves here: buying a car. We looked for a while, mostly online, and eventually found a 1992 Jeep Cherokee Limited in Kangaroo Flats: a shiny black one, naturally. Smaller than our original choice (like a Toyota Prado) but in good nick and oh-so-much-fun to drive, both on-road and off.
  
(No sooner have I washed it than Dee goes into full-time 4WD and dirties it up again. I think she can wash it next time.)
  
I&#8217;m talking to a potential employer &#8212; the same brilliant young company I worked for in London &#8212; but in the meantime we&#8217;ve been exploring rural (and not so rural) Victoria, looking for a place of our own. Dee has also discovered an as-yet untapped skill: casting a fishing line!
  
We haven&#8217;t found a home yet (still looking), although one cute place we viewed had large rooms, a lot of potential and, the real kicker, a couple of kangaroos in the front yard when we pulled up &#8212; but someone else has already made an offer! So we keep looking: somewhere near Kyneton, perhaps, or Daylesford. Somewhere out of town, up to an hour from the city centre &#8212; our own little rural retreat. Just so long as we have fast Internet!
