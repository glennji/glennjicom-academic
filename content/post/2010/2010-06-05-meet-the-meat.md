<!--StartFragment-->Our last day in Strasbourg we walked around (a lot!) and found a local place for lunch &#8212; and I do mean local. The menus were 

_en francais, mit Deutsche_ if we really wanted it, but no _anglais_. So we ordered pretty much at random &#8212; although we could have a pretty good guess at _salade/salat_, there was no real way to know that &#8220;_Ros bif_&#8221; was neither &#8220;roast&#8221; nor &#8220;beef&#8221;, but rather a third thing altogether: _cheval_.
  
I looked it up when we got to Austria. Yep, I ate horse for dinner. It was delicious, in case anyone is wondering.
  
That night, before our train, we tried another local dish: sauerkraut for two, with a strong German influence. It was basically just a whole plate of meat with a little pickled cabbage! (Damien, maybe you can scan your postcard and put it up somewhere &#8212; it was almost exactly as portrayed.)
