Just a quick note to let everyone know we made it to Moscow &#8212; a 23 hour train ride from Warsaw, but I think about 22 of those hours were taken up by passport checks, with another hour to change the wheels to the Russian gauge.

Nobody here speaks english, so I better figure out some &#8220;survival Russian&#8221;, da?
