I missed it when it was shown on television, but this week my boss (a motorcyclist) lent me &#8220;The Long Way Round&#8221;: Charlie Boorman and Ewan McGregor&#8217;s motorbike trip from London to New York via Siberia and Alaska. Arguably a mistake on his behalf, as Dee and I sat down this Saturday morning and watched the first three episodes with growing feelings of awe and shared excitement.
  
And so, in 2010, we&#8217;re packing all our belongings into a shipping container, hoisting our back-packs and catching trains (and maybe some buses) from London to Singapore via Hungary, Siberia, Mongolia, China and Vietnam.
  
Okay, it&#8217;s not motorcycling, but nor is it the normal (20 hour?) flight out of Heathrow. I&#8217;ve got an Australia motorcycle license, but Dee doesn&#8217;t &#8212; and from the look of some of the places that Charlie and Ewan go, you don&#8217;t want to attempt it unless you&#8217;re an international film star, with associated support crew, sponsorship and local recognition and admiration. After just the first three episodes, it&#8217;s quite amazing how many times they&#8217;ve been offered beds and food from the locals.
  
We&#8217;ve had some experience of the trains in Europe when we did a mini-tour a few years ago, so hopefully our expectations aren&#8217;t too idealistic &#8212; especially after &#8220;first class&#8221; on Trenitalia had us sitting on milk crates, barefoot and dirty, in the shared bar carriage, knocking back Peroni and wine in a desperate attempt to get drowsy enough to sleep in the 35-degree night heat. Okay, so they didn&#8217;t have any say over the weather that summer&#8230;
  
Dee has found a site describing, &#8220;How to travel from London to Sydney without flying,&#8221; and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re adapting for our own needs. So we&#8217;ll use Eurail passes to get to Vienna, then hopefully take the original Orient Express (the cheap one, not the tourist &#8220;experiential&#8221; one) to the twin-cities of Buda and Pest. Somehow we&#8217;ll get from there to Moscow, then take the Trans-Siberian through Siberia, then Mongolia and into Beijing, China.
  
Trains in China, we&#8217;re told, are very good, so we shouldn&#8217;t have trouble getting around &#8212; travelling south, possibly with a short trip across to Lhasa, to Guilin and eventually Shanghai. From China, it&#8217;s Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore, then a flight &#8220;home&#8221; to Melbourne. (Details are sketchy, but hey, that&#8217;s how we roll ;-).)
  
We&#8217;ve also been discussing what to do when we get to Australia, and the plan is an extended 4WD camping holiday around the coast. 6 months on the road? _6 months out of the office??_ Sounds good to me.
