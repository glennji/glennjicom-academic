It is snowing in London today. The worst in 18 years, says Danielle&#8217;s cabby, and more set for tomorrow. Most of the tube is down, or severely delayed &#8211; not the Victoria Line, strangely &#8211; and my office is just about empty. Which is okay for me, because I&#8217;ve taken my shoes and socks off and sequestered a small portable heater that was on a colleague&#8221;s desk to warm my toecicles, legacy of a mis-step into an icy puddle only metres from my door.
  
Climate-change is brilliant! Picture it, Britain: a Winter Wonderland for six months of the year, and a humid, tropical oasis for the other six. With resulting destructive and violent storms in between, of course.
  
The walk this morning was fun. The city is pretty under a layer of the white stuff, but there&#8221;s not much chance to look up and admire it &#8211; eyes down on the treacherous icy foot paths and snow-covered cobblestone lanes, else it&#8217;s argon over titanium for a bruised and wet behind. And I don&#8221;t think the few people in the office would appreciate me &#8220;dropping trou&#8221; and drying my undies on the heater the way I can with wet socks &#8230;
  
It&#8217;s warmer, and thicker, than when it snowed in Edinburgh. The wind is icy, but perhaps the built-up office blocks provide more cover against it. Overhead, a grey ceiling looms like an enormous doona (duvet) stuffed with snowflakes, trapping what heat comes from buildings and people and cups of cocoa and warm crumpets. Oh dear, I&#8217;ve made myself hungry.
  
Do I venture out? It&#8221;s snowing again now, I can see through the windows, laying down another layer. Think I&#8221;ll dry my socks first &#8230;
