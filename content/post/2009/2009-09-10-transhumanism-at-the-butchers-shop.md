The theme of last night&#8217;s Butchers Shop, organised by hip indy magazine Bad Idea, was transhumanism. We drank a little gin, then settled into the body-warm Victoria operating theatre for a little slice-and-dice of two short stories of human augmentation: in one, our narrator upgrades his heart; the other creates a xenographic sommelier with the nose of a canine. A little role-play, some heckling, then a chance for Matthew de Abaitua to wax lyrical over Paris Hilton&#8217;s doggy palace, peacocks and peahens, and consciousness as a evolutionary frivolity.

  The second half saw Cory Doctorow, Gwyneth Jones and the delightfully irreverent Ian Watson under the gas-lamps and answering questions about technological singularities, the nature of consciousness, humanity & identity and the impact of immortality. I wanted to put down a few thoughts here &#8212; because I was too mild to speak over the collective, or possibly just because I had time to think on the walk home.

### The Singularity

<div>
  Gwyneth Jones had this right, I think: there are no 1-dimensional &#8220;points&#8221;, in matter or history, and any &#8220;line in the sand&#8221; is arbitrary and necessarily drawn after we&#8217;ve passed it. Cory Doctorow went further, drawing similarities between the concept of a singularity and the eschatological &#8220;armageddon&#8221; point &#8211; they were both invented by limited-capacity minds extrapolating out from locally-observed datasets.

&#8220;Things&#8221; are speeding up, however. The rate of change of computing power is the most often cited example &#8212; processing power, whether measured in MIPS or the decimal FLOPS, is increasing exponentially &#8212; but increasing change-differential is affecting all parts of society, albeit at different rates. We are living in Alvin Toffler&#8217;s &#8220;Future Shock&#8221; world now; it is entirely possible to become homesick for a place we never left (just talk to some older Caucasian Londoners and you will see what I mean).
