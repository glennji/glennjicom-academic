Another late night for me. My project at work is pretty demanding, with very tight deadlines and quite a bit to do in each sprint. I’m trying to keep on top of it, but it does mean I’ve done a bit more “out of hours work” than I’d like.

I still feel pretty positive — about work, life, kids, fun, motorcycles, health — so something is working for me. A low carb diet! Ketosis! Regular exercise! Something.

Look, I’m even writing ‘blog posts again.
