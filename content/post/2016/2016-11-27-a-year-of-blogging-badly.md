  My last post here was July. <em>/me sighs</em>.
</p>

<p dir="auto">
  It’s not that we haven’t been doing things that are worthy of writing about — things I might want to remember later, to read and reminisce, to recall what it was like to be “young and free” (read: almost 40 and a parent) in my (hopefully short-lived¹) dotage. But, somehow, it has become very difficult to find the time/space to actually order my thoughts in to anything like a coherent narrative, let alone record them.
</p>

<p dir="auto">
  This paragraph alone has take 15 minutes and three interruptions. Moreover, that was as far as I could get — it’s now been about four hours (and one couch fort) since my last sentence. Sheesh.
</p>

This is why we have no time to ourselves. :-)" align="middle" width="719" height="719" class="aligncenter" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bondi beach bums</figcaption></figure>

<p dir="auto">
  I better write quickly, then: In the last six months, I’ve changed jobs, bought a motorcycle, gone camping, been hit with a tax bill and started a business.
</p>

<p dir="auto">
  I’m now working as a software developer for a “start-up support” company called <a href="http://industrieit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndustrieIT</a>, and although the project hours are still very demanding (we’ve built a cryptographically secure datastore, and will be migrating from the client’s in-house datacentre to Amazon) the “feel” of the place is much, much better than at my last role. (Sad but familiar story at my old job, really: new management, including CEO and CTO, and the whole feel of the place turned bad. Small companies thrive (or dive) on personalities, I think, and I just think the personalities they hired for (some of) the “C-*” roles were not right. CLV.)

  At IIT, we have a group of smart folks — developers, dev-ops, lawyers, designers — and we all just get along, for the most part. We work in “squads”, try to self-organise and actually have fun when we can (board games, beer and wine, brown-bag learning sessions, agility). In fact, the worst part of my current project is that I have to be onsite (a bank)!

  This October it was my 20-year high-school reunion, and in the spirit of “mid-life crisis” I bought a 1992 BMW K100LT, bright yellow, and rode it to central Victoria, camping in a swag along the way. Worthy of a post on it’s own, too — it was fun, but rushed, and I would’ve preferred to either camp in one spot for the full week.
</p>

<p dir="auto">
  I haven’t ridden since. A <a href="http://glennji.com/portfolio/bmw-k100lt-cafe-tourer/">new project for 2017</a>, however: the bike came with a “spares” bike, which I’ve decided to (attempt to) restore into a high-tech-but-classic tourer — Arduino-powered telemetry, 3d-camera, audio pickup for the sweet pipe rumble², HUD and satnav on minimal front fairing windshield, even Bluetooth biometrics if we can manage it. I’ll need to talk to Uncle Peter the Motorcycle Mechanic methinks.
</p>

<p dir="auto">
  (I even have a deadline: <a href="http://www.motogp.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MotoGP 2017</a>. I’ll be riding down with a crew and enjoying a weekend of house-party mania and bike fanaticism. If I can do that on my own BMW K-* resto, I will be Legend.)
</p>

<p dir="auto">
  Scroll up to remind myself what else I mentioned in the opening paragraphs … oh yes, the certainty of taxes! (See footnote 1 below for somewhat-related aside.)
</p>

<p dir="auto">
  This is depressing so I’ll keep it short: the share options I got from a certain Silicon Valley wild-child are so far worth nothing but an additional $30K, from me, to the the ATO. I’m paying it off in monthly installments; hell may freeze over before we’re done (look who’s going to be the president of the USA, after all). If we manage to sell, we’ll be sitting pretty — there are no indications that we’ll actually be <em>able</em> to sell, unfortunately, and nothing to say that we’ll get the money back if the options just lapse. (This system. Seriously.)
</p>

<p dir="auto">
  And the business? Not mine, really, but Dee’s. I have high hopes for this, to be honest. We better get some more ‘blog posts going there too!
</p>

<p dir="auto">
  All in all? It’s been busy, but I think 2017 will be fun.
</p>

<p dir="auto">
  <em>Footnotes</em><br />1. “Short-lived dotage”: I’m firmly in the “optimistic immortalist” camp, in that I hold out a possibly unreasonable hope that the most common forms of death will be cured in time for me to achieve “practical immortality” — freedom from disease and age-related dysfunction. Whether it’s a gradual outcome of our admittedly slow and error-prone science, or we bootstrap either ourselves or an artificial intelligence into some kind of post-Rapture <em>vita ex machina,</em> I’m hoping I’m young enough to experience what I suspect is near-inevitable.
</p>

2. “Sweet pipe rumble”: Tell me you wouldn’t order that from <a href="https://www.blackstarpastry.com.au/" target="_blank" title="Oh the carbs!" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Star</a> if you saw it on the menu (and line wasn’t too long)!
