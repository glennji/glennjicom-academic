  We’re all recovering from a stomach bug this week.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  You may have already seen the photo: Jules bumped his head on Saturday, playing with a plastic crate we’d bought to allow us to put some of his older toys into storage ahead of his birthday. It wasn’t too bad, although it came up in a nasty bruise very quickly, and it was on top of two other head-bumps he’d given himself at preschool in the preceding week.
</p>

  He was fine after a good cry, albeit a little more wary of the crate. The next morning, however, he was throwing up — a sign of potential concussion and head injury — so after a call to a nurses’ helpline we bundled him off to Sydney Children’s Hospital for a check-up.

  A few hours later he got the all clear. One lymph node was up, apparently, but doctor suggested it was likely he had a bug of some kind. We kept him home from preschool on Monday to keep an eye on him.

  He was back at school on Tuesday, but by then Danielle was feeling the first effects of the (now confirmed) stomach bug — we came home instead of heading to work. It hit me a few hours later, although not as badly — I’m not throwing up, just extremely queasy — and today we’re both just exhausted from the disturbed sleep and fever.
