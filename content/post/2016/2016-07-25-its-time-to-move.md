  There is, of course, no urgency — we’re in a lease after all — but we’ve both agreed we should keep an eye out for a better property in a more accessible location i.e. Annandale or Leichhardt at this point. Considering we saw <em>the perfect (for us) property</em> in Annandale, and might’ve got it if we’d offered the same rent we’re currently paying, it seems like it might be worth the cost of lease-break just to avoid diving into the rental market around the same time that all the University students do. C’est la vie.

  We’ve also started discussing where we <em>ultimately</em> want to live — where we would actually buy a house and “settle down”, particularly if we could swing “full time work from home” (or better, “run our own business from home”), and with a view towards the next 10 years.
